title: This Week in Hop Butcher Vol. 4
---

## It's been awhile since we've been here, but after having both of today's releases from [[Hop Butcher for the World]], and my lack of wanting to do real productive work or consumption, I figured I'd jot some notes down about [[Value of Midnight]] and [[Your Wish Is Granted]], especially given the fact it's looking like my time with access to [[Hop Butcher for the World]] is coming to an end with an inevitable move to [[Seattle]].

## First up is [[Value of Midnight]], a [[Double IPA]] with [[Strata]] and [[Vic Secret]]:

## If you are familiar with Strata and Vic Secret, you already know this is going to be a wonderful brew. Despite Strata being listed first, Vic Secret seems to be the more dominant hop here and it steals the show. The thing I've always loved about Vic Secret is it fits perfectly in the [[New England IPA]] style, but always seems to provide a little bit of bitterness that you wouldn't neccesarily look for in this style. It's main profile brings some pineapple and pine flavor that just speaks to me. Strata on the other hand, usually has this huge citrus thing going on that has blown me away in the past. Like a brother to Citra almost, but with a hint of strawberry and pine. I’m missing a little bit of that orange and strawberry vibe from the Strata here though. Maybe it’s how the two work together rather than just Strata
