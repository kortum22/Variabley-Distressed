## [[Homebrew]] [[Beer]] # 5 [[Quack Brews]]

## A grape juice Blond Belgian (variation on [[Sir Stone Age, King of the Vibes]])

## Planning this out to be a mothers day/aunt birthday present next month, hence the grape juice. This will be [[Sir Stone Age, King of the Vibes]], but not soured, adding some acid malt, and then throwing a gallon of grape juice in the fermentor after a week for another two weeks to give it some wine like characteristics.

## Bought a dozen 375ml Belgian Ale bottles specifically for this brew. Been trying to get bottles to match the brews, although I'll use whatever is on hand, when I take a picture for [[Untappd]] it's always in the canonical bottle.
