## [[June 16th, 2020]] - Check
### 09:02 Temp is right at 690 (upper limit for yeast, lowest I can get in closet), and we are bubbling big time. 
#### Planning to do a bagged dry-hop of Strata 1oz and remove, both should be around 15:00. 
##### Scratch that. removed the dates above because I am going to wait until the last three days of primary to add the strata so it’s easier to remove during transfer to cold secondary. 

## [[June 28th, 2020]] - First Dry Hop
### Dropped in a 1oz sanitized bag of [[Strata]]. 
#### Didn’t stir or anything like that. 

### Plan will be to dry hop for three-four days and then transfer to smaller fermentor and throw in fridge for a couple weeks, dry-hopping the last few days, take it out of the fridge for day and then bottle.

## [[July 3rd, 2020]] - Lagering
### Transferred to 5g fermentor and placed in fridge. 
#### Dry-hop strained and removed with hop bag. 

#### Planning to dry-hop again for the last five days. 
##### Three in fridge, remove and let settle for last two. 

#### Plan to add dry-hops on [[July 18th, 2020]] and bottle on [[July 24th, 2020]]

## [[July 18th, 2020]] - Cold Dry-Hop
### Used my new hop cylinder thing for the wide mouth bubbler and added 1oz of [[Strata]], after sanitizing.
#### Left the sanitizer in the bottling bucket to bottle next week.

## [[July 24th, 2020]] - Remove to Settle
### Took the fermentor out of fridge and in position to siphon and then bottle. 

## [[July 25th, 2020]] - Bottling Day
### Transferred to bottling bucket. 

### Boiled 4oz of priming sugar in 2 cups of water. 
#### Put about half in the bottom of the bucket. 

#### Other half over the top after transfer. 

### Ended up with a little under 4 gallons.
