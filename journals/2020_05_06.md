## After seeing [[Phil N.]] and [[Jack Baty]] talk about org-mode and org-[[Roam]] stuff, I really feel like I'd love it if I could ever actually figure it out. I've got it installed, I think, (at least I was in a how to navigate tutorial thing that seemed to go forever)but most of this stuff is over my head and learning it, knowing there's a chance it won't stick feels like a waste of time at this point.
