## #[[Correspondence]] #[[From]] #[[h0p3]]

## Hey Kevin,

## I'm quick to write in my own wiki, but slow to correspond these days. I'm glad to have the opportunity to mull things around.

## Hey!!

## `So happy to hear from you. I’ve been keeping an eye on your wiki and now that I finally have one, I was hoping you’d eventually come across mine.`

## Same. I've been keeping an eye on your site. Glad I stumbled onto it. I hope it will be useful.

## `It’s been a joy (mostly) so far.`

## Ah, well, I hope to see you dive in. I can see you're still split between the options. It's expensive to unify ourselves.

## `I’m sorry I fell off for awhile, I genuinely enjoyed our ongoing conversation, but 2019 just threw some wrenches in things. Not that 2020 is off to the greatest start for the world...`

## `But anywho, thanks for reaching out.`

## `-KK`

## Yeah, I realize life gets busy. There's going to be some wax and wane. 2019 and 2020 have been exceptionally busy. Hopefully, we can pick it back up.

## `P.S.`

## `I was just looking at your wiki after I sent this, sorry for the extra tagging with the name and stuff...`

## Don't worry about it. It's not a problem. Glad to connect.

## Sincerely,

## [h0p3](https://philosopher.life/#h0p3)
