## Taking [[Momma]] to a couple of my favorite suburb breweries today as a ‚Äúfamily bonding time‚Äù before I move to [[Seattle]].

## So the bad thing about the way I set-up [[Yesterday's Review]] is that the transclusion on the page only shows the block refs and not my notes on them. 
### Maybe I should write my notes and put the block refs under them. I don‚Äôt like the idea of reversing them especially juggling the thought and the block, but that would definitely work best for the pages transclusion. 

## Have a [[SQL]] and [[Excel]] test I have to take for [[Build - Job Search]]...

### Not worried about the [[Excel]] stuff (although I am a bit rusty), but [[SQL]] is something I have only used sparingly. I did the [[Khan Academy]] course earlier in [[The Quarantine Times]], but need to freshen up. Am going to take tomorrow since today is pretty packed already. Hopefully that doesn‚Äôt hurt my chances. I can always say I had a busy work day...

## [[Yesterday's Review]]
### Living over cliffs and water in a beautiful home like this would be a dream.
#### ((421a2ad8-1344-4add-86af-f517552615ff))

### I think it‚Äôs pretty settled the route and stops we will take/make. Going to check with [[Jaystone]] first though to see if he has suggestions.

### Touched on the review process already...

### Had a nice dinner. Ordered Chinese food from my favorite place back where I grew up. Nice to see [[Val]] too since she lives in [[Los Angeles]] now.
