## Potential second route for [[Seattle Road Trip 2020]] in case our northern route is too snowy.
### First Stop:

### Second Stop:

## Buyer still doesn’t have clear to close... #[[Condo Sale - Winchester]]
### Lawyer has me going out to sign docs today and still planning on moving forward with closing this Friday... So we will see what happens... Losing my confidence...

### Going to end up having to pay $316.11 at closing... but will get that back and a tiny bit more after escrow... 
#### Thought I was going to come out about a grand ahead...

## [[Politics Journal]]
### I’ve done an awful job at sticking to my no political news until 11/7 when I’m in Seattle... but seriously...?

##### There is one side that stokes violence, one side that spreads hatred, one side that can’t say Black Lives Matter, one side trying to take health care away from people, one side that is actively fighting to take away gag and trans rights in the courts right now.
