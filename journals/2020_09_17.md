## [[Morning Pages]] {{{word-count null}}}
### So here we are actually doing morning pages for the first time in forever. In Roam. On the iPad Pro with Smart Keyboard w/ Trackpad. It is pretty nice.

### I’ve been neglecting Roam a lot lately, but a lot of that has to do with not really having a set agenda or time behind a computer. Trying to get myself to use the iPad more and more and with the new updates that might become a reality.

### On a more positive note, I’ve been in my Field Notes a lot more, especially sketching. That’s probably a big reason I haven’t been here though. And my Media Diet routine is completely out the window, although the Drafts widget might help with that a little to make it even easier than it already is.’

## Starting [[David Lynch’s MasterClass]]
### Got a free year of [[MasterClass]] for being a “student”
