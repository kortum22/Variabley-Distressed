## Think my interview today actually went really well.
### Felt a bit awkward at the end, but overall, I feel like I really fit the role and the pay is slightly more than I was looking for as well.

### I’m in the final three candidates and he has the other two left to interview still.
#### Next steps would be to interview with two other people.

## Stoked for the [[NBA Draft]] tonight
### Really hoping the [[Chicago Bulls]] don’t fuck this up.
#### There are a few guys I would be okay with them taking, but my heart is set on [[Devin Vassell]] who is a fringe top ten pick based on most mock drafts, and with the Bulls picking at 4, I hope they don’t pass on him because he “isn’t good enough” for the 4th pick.
##### I’d be happy with a few other guys too though.
###### [[LaMelo Ball]]

###### [[Killian Hayes]]

###### [[Deni Avdija]]

###### [[Saddiq Bey]]

###### —————

###### [[Isaac Okoro]]

###### [[Patrick Williams]]

###### [[Tyrese Haliburton]]

###### [[Robert Woodard II]]

###### [[Jaden McDaniels]]

##### Although, half of these guys I’d prefer to see them trade down for and get something extra given the fact they have the fourth pick. 
###### This may go against what I said above, but it makes sense to me...

### [[Chicago Bulls]] drafted [[Patrick Williams]] with the fourth pick.
#### Pretty happy with this. Hopefully they see something more than me that can really be developed into more than just a 3 and D player, and can hopefully play some at the 3 with Lauri and WCj.
