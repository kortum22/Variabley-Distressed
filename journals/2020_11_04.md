## [[2020 Presidential Election]]
### 09:54 Not feeling great right now. 227-213 Biden at the moment. 

### Best path to success seems to be AZ, NV, WI, MI with PA, GA, NC still open as well, not needed and a little tougher, but still a slim possibility. 
#### AP and [[Axios]] called AZ this morning, but [[The New York Times]], still show it open..

### Senate is looking tough too. We picked up Kelly in AZ and Hickenlooper in CO, but lost Dougy Jones in AL and Graham romped Harrison in SC...
#### Hoping Warnock can take GA, and then we still need one more to even the Senate. Cunningham in NC is the best shot right now. 

#### Ossoff isn’t eliminated in GA yet and also Gideon vs Collins in Maine. So we have three shots to grab one **if** Warnock can hold. 

### Wisconsin!!!!! I don’t hate you anymore!
#### Michigan and Nevada! it’s up to you now to save the world. 

## [[Seattle Road Trip 2020]]
### I have to say, it’s exceedingly uncomfortable being in a place that voted over 85% for Trump...
#### On top of that, I feel vilified for wearing a mask everywhere. 

### Left [[Minneapolis]], MN

### Stopped in [[Fargo]], ND for lunch
#### [[Pounds - Fargo]] for lunch.
##### [[Beer Log]]
###### [[Iron Horse - Fargo]]

### Ended in [[Dickinson]], ND

## [[Media Diet]]
### [[The Queen’s Gambit - Netflix]] E2+3
