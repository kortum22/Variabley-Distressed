## [[Seattle Move]] Day 2 of Apartment Searching
### Just one apartment on the docket today. 
#### Will be going solo since TK is heading to meet her new co-workers. 

### [[Out and About]]
#### [[Porkchop & Co.]] for breakfast
##### Got a pepperoni pizza bagel, buttermilk biscuit, and coffee. 

### Apartment number 3
#### Best location by far. 

#### Space is good, balcony is a plus. 

#### High end of what we wanted to pay though. 

#### Like it better than Apartment 2, but 2 had the cool double patio and much cheaper. 2 is in a nothing area though, to where 3 is right in the heart of where we want to be.
