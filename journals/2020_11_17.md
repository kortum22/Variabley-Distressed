## Caught up on a lot of the data in pages here...
### I don’t actually know what the end goal is.

### But I’ve always enjoyed building these sort of things out and tracking, without really having an end goal.

### It really has become more of a detailed journal with background info and data than anything really.

### I can see what I did on a given day or see what days I watched or did a certain things, which is cool, I guess.

## [[Media Diet]]
### [[Vision (2015)]] 11+12

### [[Industry - HBO]] S1E1+2
#### Kind of a weird show. [[Dazed and Confused]] but with recent college grads at an investment bank in London?
##### No real plot that I can tell, just a day in the life of four/five of these kids. 

##### Some interesting characters, but it’s very bright and frantic. 

##### Going to stick with it a little bit to see where it goes. 

#### Starting to like it a bit more after the second episode. 

## [[Beer Log]]
### [[Apricult]] split with [[TK]]

### [[Space Rex]]

## [[Wellness Log]]
### 5.74mi [[Run]] 1:03:49
#### Lots of walking with this given how it’s by far the farthest I’ve ever gone.

#### Went to Gas Works Park and back.
