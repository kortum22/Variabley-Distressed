## [[Roam]] messing with how things work on mobile. 
### The toolbar above the keyboard can only be accessed by dismissing the keyboard now. It’s the only way I know to tab in on outlines, which has become a pain in the ass for me now. 

## Starting to update my address for services, subscriptions, and accounts...
### Trying to think what else I actually get in the mail besides junk...

### Complete:
#### [[The New Yorker]]

#### [[The Atlantic]]

## —————

## [[Sports Log]]
### [[Newcastle]] vs [[Everton]]

## [[Media Diet]]
### [[The Fifth Element (1997)]]
