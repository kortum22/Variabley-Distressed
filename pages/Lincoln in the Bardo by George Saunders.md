## Background::
### Actually bought this on my [[Kindle]] back when it came out and only got like 5 or 10% through before I gave up. Decided to give the audiobook a try since it has a huge cast and I could get it from the library.

### Still didn't really love it.
#### Was mostly lost throughout most of it, especially the first half. 

#### The prose was nice, but being an audiobook, there were many occasions where I just stopped paying attention, which definitely didn't help the odd format of the book for me.
