## testing out [[Roam]] from the iPad. 
### seems like it works decently well. 

### could use a shortcut for linking though since brackets aren’t easily accessible from the software keyboard. but if I ever get a chance to get the new iPad keyboard maybe that will change for me. [[Test]]

### 

## #[[Quick Capture]]
### I feel like [[Roam]] is more likely to stick for me than TiddlyWiki though. Easier to just get into typing, and the save issues I’m having have been a real struggle. 

## #[[Quick Capture]]
### Downloaded a few other apps that have some publishing/public features as well to play around with: Coda, Notion, Airtable (Agenda too but can’t publish). don’t think I’ll use these as I think they are mostly trying to be fancy for the sake of being fancy, but maybe I can find a use for Airtable. 

### Drafts app as a public web app would be cool. The structure of it is how I think now, so to do a TiddlyWiki in that way where everything just works. yeah.
