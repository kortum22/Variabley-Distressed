### Been a pretty lazy day so far.

### Watched a lot of soccer, applied to a couple jobs, found some more to apply to later... and now we are here. Just realized I havenâ€™t really had much to eat yet either.

### Realizing my link logs donâ€™t bring in the publication very well, at least to add [[]] in order to make them linked. May tweak the Siri Shortcut so that they still go to [[TIV]] in the current form, but then when it gets sent to [[Drafts]], to later be sent to [[Roam]], it should have the pub name linked, while not losing the actual link to the article.

## Havenâ€™t even set up my [[October]] [[Field Notes]] book yet... Been using this for everything. 

## I used to hate glasses with stems, but now I have an itch to get some teku glasses...

## How is it, that all ingredients on a pizza take the exact same amount of time to cook?

## So apparently if you let your [[Apple Music]] [[Subscription]] expire, they delete all of your playlists, even those containing tracks you own...?

## [[Airr]] seems like a pretty cool podcast app to pull _highlights_ out of shows, but just listening to ten seconds of a show with it I realize how much Overcast really does, not to mention the playlists I rely on. Would like to see Overcast improve the clipping in a similar manner.
