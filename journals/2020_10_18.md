## [[Readwise]] and [[Blinkist]] trials are expiring soon... again... ðŸ˜¢
### I think I can find a way to swing them once we are in [[Seattle]], but lots of last minute expenses and fees are always popping up, plus Iâ€™m trying to enjoy my last couple weeks in [[Chicago]], which costs $$$$$$$. 

## [[Safari]] on [[iOS]] seems to have a mind of its own. 
### I like to keep the wikis and roams I visit as the bottom tabs on my phone, but everyday they somehow get mixed in with the other tabs I have. 

### I don't move them myself, the only action I can think of is opening new tabs, but still, the wikis and roams get mixed with tabs that have existed for awhile already...

## [[Yesterday's Review]]
### Still hopeful for this job despite my lack of confidence in my test. But Iâ€™m sure they have plenty of people who did better...
