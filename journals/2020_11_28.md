### Have basically all my eggs in this basket and if I don’t get it, chances are unemployment will run out before I land a job.

### It would also be about a 20k raise on my old job, which isn’t bad at all, but a bit of that would be the cost of living from Chicagoland burbs to right in the middle of Seattle.

## Made lobster, fresh ravioli, and zucchini for a late lunch. 

## Sad that [[Tony Hsieh]] died. 
### I followed and read a lot about him since his rise with [[Zappos]] correlated with my education and I always loved the ethos he seemed to stand for from a corporate culture perspective.
