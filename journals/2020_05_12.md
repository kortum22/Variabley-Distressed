## Today's #[[GIF]]

## Got a two year update from [[Yes Plz]] through [[Kickstarter]] and I really miss it. I subscribed for about forty weeks until I started drinking more and more espresso when I received an espresso machine. The extra cost over the really good beans I could get at the local roaster a three minutes walk from me just wasn't worth it. Maybe I'll do it as a monthly treat when I have a steady job again. 

## Plan::
### DONE Peloton 20 min low impact

### DONE Meditate [[Headspace]] 20 min Pro 2 Day 2

### DONE Certify for UE

## [[The Atlantic]]
### [The Coronavirus Was an Emergency Until Trump Found Out Who Was Dying - The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/americas-racial-contract-showing/611389/)
#### The implied terms of the racial contract are visible everywhere for those willing to see them. A 12-year-old with a toy gun is a dangerous threat who must be met with lethal force; armed militias drawing beads on federal agents are heroes of liberty. Struggling white farmers in Iowa taking billions in federal assistance are hardworking Americans down on their luck; struggling single parents in cities using food stamps are welfare queens. Black Americans struggling in the cocaine epidemic are a “bio-underclass” created by a pathological culture; white Americans struggling with opioid addiction are a national tragedy. Poor European immigrants who flocked to an America with virtually no immigration restrictions came “the right way”; poor Central American immigrants evading a baroque and unforgiving system are gang members and terrorists.

## Bummer about reading [[Instapaper]] articles on my [[Kindle]] is that highlights don’t sync to [[Readwise]].

## Resubscribed to [[The New Yorker]] (Print + Digital) for $120. I am a weak man.

## Also did a monthly subscription to the [[Stratechery]] + [[Dithering]] bundle for $15/month. Figured I'd give it a try for a little.
