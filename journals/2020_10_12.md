## [[Seattle Move]]
### Starting to get a bit nervous we will get denied the application for our apartment since I’m not working. 

### The application says you need to make 2.5x rent and it can be supplemented by savings. 

### Now they are asking for 3x rent. 

### TK makes about 2.3x rent. 

### We do have enough in savings to cover rent for a year, so we should be fine, but this shit makes me irrationally nervous and anxious. 
#### Although most of TKs savings is just in her checking. That shouldn’t matter, I don’t think...

### Sent two of TK’s pay stubs, and a statement of her account that has enough in it to pay fir a year of rent already. 
#### Then they needed my info and said, since I’m furloughed, they’d need six months of statements from me. I sent them plus my Betterment statements (2 accounts).

### Really don’t want to lose this place because of me...

## Really fun to see [[Sphygmus]] pop up on [[Phil N.]]’s [[Roam]]. 
### Haven’t been by [[Sphygmus]] in awhile, I feel like there was a period of time they stopped updating and checking it fell out of my habit. Was fun to dive into the wiki again. 

### [[Roam]] is definitely harder to follow along as a reader of you don’t check in everyday. 
#### I do check Phil and Jack’s probably at least three times a week so it isn’t a problem for me. 

#### The Home I have setup I think would be useful in this regard along with favoriting pages. 
##### These should be focused on important things and those that only come up maybe less than once a week so it’s easier to find loose threads. 

#### And for the record, I agree with [[Jack Baty]] [here](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/jackbaty/page/HV7QkcQPV) and it’s why I think I’ve done a better job being consistent on Roam, while inputting and using it for far more uses than I did TW. 
##### I go off the assumption people aren’t reading here, although I think I write in a style that maybe conflicts with that assumption. 
###### It allows me to put more in here. Maybe not as much as if it were private, but way more than I would on [[TIV]]. 

## Picked up my car from the shop. So nice to have it back. 

## [[Condo Sale - Winchester]]
### Appraisal went through smoothly “at value”(?) and the buyer is working on utility switch over so it seems like it maybe won’t fall through as we kind of expected given the shady financing. 
#### Need to make sure our apartment application goes through now. Going to be pissed if we get rejected because I don’t have a job...

## __the barrage against kickscondor.com continues into its 96th day. the cyberwarfare taking place under the hood is unlike anything we’ve seen in human history, rivaled only by the besieging of beyonce.horse in 2016. thread incoming!__ #[[Kicks Condor]]
### No idea what’s happening here still, but it’s a joy to pop in. 

## I struggle with wanting to read articles and magazines on my kindle (where I can’t really share highlights or send to my link log) vs. in [[Instapaper]] or magazine apps where I can highlight and easy use the share sheet...

#### I am very biased, but it’s funny that most of the framing devices he uses at the end are to diminish Jordan’s feats and forget about James’ faults (6-0, 2011, etc.).
