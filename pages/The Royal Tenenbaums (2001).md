## Background::
### This was the second to last [[Wes Anderson]] I hadn’t seen. [[The Fantastic Mr. Fox]] being the only one left now. 

### Surprised this came before [[Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]] and [[The Darjeeling Limited]]. I feel like this fixed a lot of the issues I had with those, and feels much more like it’s on a linear path to where he really starts to become a master of his craft with [[Moonrise Kingdom]] and then the masterpiece [[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]
