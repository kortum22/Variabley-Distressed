## Background::
### Was really psyched for this given it was an adult animation show from the guy who created [[Adventure Time]]. While the animation is definitely bonkers and really cool. It isn't at all what I expected.

### It's basically a [[Duncan Trussell]] podcast, where he interviews different, real people, and they animate crazy shit behind that, occasionally mentioning something in the conversation that is related to the animation, but mostly just diving into real life topics, like [[Marijuana Legalization]] and [[Death]].
