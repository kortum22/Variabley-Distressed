## Did a 15min Low Impact [[Peloton]] ride

## Getting increasingly nervous about using [[Roam]] for everything.
### And was too lazy to really do anything but log shows i watched.

## Diving into my [[Field Notes]] books a little bit today. The pages for the last two weeks have been basically empty :(

## Haven't read a single page in my book for awhile either.

## Like I said before [[Balance]] is difficult for me. Went all in on brewing and podcasts for a weekend and now it feels like the whole world is collapsing in on me with everything I have been ignoring.

## Listened to a new [[Podcast]] (for me) [[Switched on Pop]] today, which did an episode [[LoFi]]. Nothing really revelatory for me, but confirmed a lot of what I was thinking about the labels and how they work/make money.
