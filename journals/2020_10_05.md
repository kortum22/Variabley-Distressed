## Trying to make this a productive day.
### Emptied out [[TK]]’s car so we can return it today.

### Put a deposit down on the movers... #[[Seattle Move]]
#### Hopefully this sale doesn’t fall through...

### Still want to get a little bit of packing done. #[[Condo Sale - Winchester]]

### Groceries, done. Got [[TK]]s check signed at the auto shop so she can hopefully deposit the insurance money now. 

### Returned [[TK]]’s car. 

### Booked a rental car for [[Seattle]] this weekend. #[[Seattle Move]]

### Setup appointments at a few different apartment buildings for this weekend. #[[Seattle Move]]

## [[Politics Journal]]
### I’ve long said, “people only care about things that effect them.” 
#### I know of Republicans who are pretty hardcore, but approve of gay marriage because they know someone who is gay. 
##### This applies to lots of things, race, immigration (DACA, especially), abortion, unemployment, health insurance. 
###### Until they or someone they know are directly effected or in need of one of these, they flat out don’t care. 

#### Maybe Trump will take [[COVID-19]] more seriously now that he’s had it. I believe a statement was released along those lines. But something shouldn’t have to effect you fir you to care about it. 

#### This is why we have the issue of racism in our country. Too many people don’t know/interact/care about people of color, so they don’t recognize the issues and since it doesn’t effect them directly they don’t care.

#### I’ve always felt like right wing politics are focused on the individual and how they, as an individual, will be effected by things as opposed to left wing politics, which looks at how the country and world as a whole will be effected. 
##### This is why cities tend to lean left, because you are always surrounded by lots of people, diverse people, and learn to care and live alongside different cultures that people in more rural areas just don’t experience, therefore, they don’t understand or care, and their political views are more focused on themselves. 

#### There’s a saying in basketball, “you’re only as good as your twelfth man.” (There’s probably a version of this in all sports.)
##### This means, you are only as good as the weakest link on the team. 

##### In our country, we are only as __great__ as those in the lower class, not those in the higher classes. 
###### Also, see [[Caste - Blinkist]]. 

#### Or how about “a rising tide raises all ships.”
##### I think this is typically used in reference to a good economy is good for all, which almost feels like a trickle down economics thing, but the way we need to look at it is raising up those less fortunate, those who lack privilege, those at a disadvantage, is good for everyone. Lift those people; and they will make the economy boom. Not the other way around. 

#### In the end, it comes down to a lack of empathy and it’s depressing to see people who just genuinely don’t care about the well being of others and the country as a whole. 

#### Yeesh, went a little long there, but this stuff has been on my mind for awhile.
