## Starting to pack a few boxes. Got most of my books and some clothes done... #[[Seattle Move]]
### I hate packing. So much.

## Was hoping my car would be out of the shop today, but it doesn’t look like that’ll happen. Will have to get it when I’m back from [[Seattle]] next week.

## Totally forgot about [[Ratatat]], which is the perfect music for upbeat instrumental given my predilection towards #LoFi recently.

## [[Roam]] is honestly the perfect place for [[Topic Journals]].
### Don’t need to open the right file or even select the right action in [[Drafts]].

### Just write the first few letters and go, from anywhere.

## Really don’t like that the unlinked references show words which contain the word you want. When I look at my run page, the unlinked references include “crunch”, which obviously is not something I want linked.
### Maybe there is a use for this I guesss for like run, runner, running, but [[Roam]] does an awful job with aliases so I wouldn’t want those included for the time being anyways.

## Downloading a shit ton of shows for my four hour flight tomorrow (and back on Sunday.) Waaaay more than I need. 
### [[The Third Day - HBO]]

### [[We Are Who We Are - HBO]]

### [[Tartakovsky’s Primal - Adult Swim]]

### [[Spirited Away (2001)]]

### [[Tehran - Apple TV]]

### [[Castlevania - Netflix]]

### [[I'm Thinking of Ending Things (2020)]]

### [[The Devil All the Time (2020)]]

### [[The Social Dilemma (2020)]]

### [[Avatar: The Last Airbender - Cartoon Network]]

### [[Never Rarely Sometimes Always (2020)]]

### [[All or Nothing: Tottenham]]

### [[Take Us Home: Leeds United]]

## Now that I let Apple Music expire, looking at my Apple Music app and seeing only albums I purchased on iTunes, it makes me think how access to all music just makes my library so booted with stuff I don’t actually listen to and it makes it harder to rediscover old records. I wish the albums I purchased as CDs were here too though. 
### Downloaded a few to my phone for the flight tomorrow.
