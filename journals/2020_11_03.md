## Oh Fuck. 
### It’s [[2020 Presidential Election]] Day. 

### Every optimistic take I see makes me shiver. 

## Going to be following along with [[Craig Mod]]’s pachinko road walk newsletter. 

## The [[Seattle Road Trip 2020]] officially begins today.
### Taking off from [[TK]]’s moms house. 

### First stop will be about 30min outside [[Minneapolis]], although I’m sure we will take a break halfway and then stop in [[Minneapolis]] for a brewery or two, if they are open...

### Leg 1 of the road trip to Seattle has been completed. Was originally planning on staying in Minneapolis, but given the election and not wanting to be in the middle of any city tonight, we loaded up on Modist, BlackStack, and Fair State beer and have hunkered down 30min out. #[[TIV]]

#### [[Modist Brewing]]
##### [[Beer Log]]

###### [[Brew Together - Modist]]

###### [[Shook Guava]]

###### [[Mango End Later]]

#### [[Famous Dave’s]]
##### take out, obviously. 

### Left [[TK]]’s Mom’s in [[Illinois]]

### Lunch at [[Culvers]] in a random place in [[Wisconsin]]

### Arrived in [[Minneapolis]]/[[Maple Grove]] for the night.

## I’m so weak. I can’t help but stare at the percentage points swing tonight. I wish I were stronger. #TIV

## Is it wrong to want things to get better??? #[[Politics Journal]]
### Because that’s what Dems want. 

### And as the Republicans businessmen will tell you, “you have to spend money, to make money”

### Dems want to spend money to raise the country as a whole, because if we are stronger as a whole, where all prices are given a chance to contribute and spend, it’s better for everyone. 
#### I had a few things I wanted to say and jumped around a bit. Might have missed the point I was aiming at (mocking Repubs for claiming this fool as a great businessman)

## Love Thy Neighbor #[[Politics Journal]]
### Maybe cities tend to be democratic where rural areas tend to be republican, because cities actually have neighbors within an acre of them and understand, even if you hate your neighbor, what’s best for them and all the rest is also best for you. 
#### And maybe their votes shouldn’t count less. 
##### Sure, let’s do electoral college but no winner take all bullshit. 
###### That actually gives equal weight ANd whatever bullshit excuse Repubs use to defend the electoral college still applies. Heck Illinois would even hand some votes to the Republican next time then.
