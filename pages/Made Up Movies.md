title: Made Up Movies
---

## I will be the first to say I don’t know anything about crafting a story or storytelling. And most of what is included here is most certainly unoriginal and iterative. 

## But, I thought it’d be fun to imagine groups of people who haven’t worked together making a movie, and a concept that idea would be around. 

## Since coming up with a few ideas, some still live over at [[Humdrum Life]] and not here yet, that I’d start to really try to build out the story. 

## The outlines give brief descriptions of points along the way with spoilers and an ending. 

## The texts are me writing it out from beginning to end, which will probably take some time. It’s not in script format, just me writing out the story as it comes to me.
