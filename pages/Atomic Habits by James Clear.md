## Quotes::
### changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.(157)

### Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.(261)

### Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.(284)

### Are you spending less than you earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones that will define your future self.(288)

### Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.(289)

### Change can take years—before it happens all at once.(336)

### Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results.(359)

### The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.(402)

### The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.(480)

### when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.(496)

### Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.(518)

### Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.(554)

### “I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses. I’ve got my husband.”(855)

### One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily habits.(859)

### Wake up Turn off alarm Check my phone Go to the bathroom Weigh myself Take a shower Brush my teeth Floss my teeth Put on deodorant Hang up towel to dry Get dressed Make a cup of tea (863)

### the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect.(964)

### Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act.(1339)

### Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.(1411)

### whatever habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find.(1437)

### We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige).(1543)

### Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.(1627)

### “I’m not confined to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.”(1632)

### You can reframe “I am nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.”(1645)
#### Note: For presentations

### But more often than not, we do it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn’t feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen. And that’s the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.(1722)

### The primary axis of the Americas runs from north to south. That is, the landmass of North and South America tends to be tall and thin rather than wide and fat. The same is generally true for Africa. Meanwhile, the landmass that makes up Europe, Asia, and the Middle East is the opposite. This massive stretch of land tends to be more east-west in shape. According to Diamond, this difference in shape played a significant role in the spread of agriculture over the centuries. When agriculture began to spread around the globe, farmers had an easier time expanding along east-west routes than along north-south ones. This is because locations along the same latitude generally share similar climates, amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes in season.(1788)

### Like a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning their workspace to reduce wasted motion, successful companies design their products to automate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible. They reduce the number of fields on each form. They pare down the number of clicks required to create an account. They deliver their products with easy-to-understand directions or ask their customers to make fewer choices.(1860)

### The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.(1871)

### Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy. Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.(1911)

### The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”(2044)

### Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.(2046)

### A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.(2060)

### Conversely, if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason to repeat it. In my research, I came across the story of a woman who had a narcissistic relative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend less time with this egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible whenever he was around. Within a few encounters, he started avoiding her because he found her so uninteresting.(2237)

### The French economist Frédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he wrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”(2275)

### Put another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.(2278)

### People who are better at delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills.(2290)

### At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.(2293)

### habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.(2390)

### As soon as one streak ends, I get started on the next one.(2422)

### Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.(2424)

### If you start with $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33 percent loss to take you back to $100.(2429)

### People who are high in agreeableness are kind, considerate, and warm. They also tend to have higher natural oxytocin levels, a hormone that plays an important role in social bonding, increases feelings of trust, and can act as a natural antidepressant.(2655)

### You don’t have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular.(2670)

### When are you enjoying yourself while other people are complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do.(2701)

### We all have limited time on this planet, and the truly great among us are the ones who not only work hard but also have the good fortune to be exposed to opportunities that favor us.(2715)

### Even if you’re not the most naturally gifted, you can often win by being the best in a very narrow category.(2731)

### Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.(2732)

### People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to them.(2740)

### Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck.(2743)

### The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty.(2777)

### But this coach was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.(2812)

### The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty.(2817)

### Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.(2842)

### The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.(2850)

### When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you stop thinking about how to do it better.(2866)

### The less energy you spend on trivial choices, the more you can spend it on what really matters.(2872)

### “Sustaining an effort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The way to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same way every time.”(2925)

### I know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in which they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of each month or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong.*(2938)

### The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you.(2975)

### Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail. —LAO TZU (2990)

### Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery (3001)

### The holy grail of habit change is not a single 1 percent improvement, but a thousand of them. It’s a bunch of atomic habits stacking up, each one a fundamental unit of the overall system.(3011)
