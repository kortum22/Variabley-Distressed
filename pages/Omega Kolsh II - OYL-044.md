## [Omega Site](https://omegayeast.com/yeast/ales/kolsch-ii)

## This Kolsch strain is warmer fermenting than [Kolsch I (OYL-017)](https://omegayeast.com/yeast/ales/kolsch-i), flocculates much better and clears more quickly, so it is a little easier to manage. It is a lager-like ale strain that’s lightly fruity, crisp and clean with a hint of sulfur that disappears with age to leave a clean ale. Accentuates hop flavors.
