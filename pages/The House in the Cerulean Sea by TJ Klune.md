### He couldn’t believe it was only Wednesday. And it was made worse when he realized it was actually Tuesday. ([Location 160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QPHT8CB&location=160))

### “I have no idea what’s going on,” he said. “I’m not even sure if I’m here.” “Yes,” Ms. Bubblegum said sympathetically. “Sounds like quite the existential crisis. Perhaps consider having it somewhere else.” ([Location 628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QPHT8CB&location=628))

### Linus turned his head, and his breath caught in his throat. It was as if the rain clouds had reached as far as they could. The gray darkness gave way to a bright and wonderful blue like Linus had never seen before. The rain stopped as they passed out of the storm and into the sun. He closed his eyes briefly, feeling the warmth through the glass against his face. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt sunlight. He opened his eyes again, and that’s when he saw it, in the distance. There was green. Bright and beautiful greens of waving grass, and what appeared to be flowers in pinks and purples and golds. They disappeared into white sand. And beyond the white was cerulean. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QPHT8CB&location=682))

### “Sometimes,” Mr. Parnassus said, “our prejudices color our thoughts when we least expect them to. If we can recognize that, and learn from it, we can become better people. ([Location 1576](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QPHT8CB&location=1576))

### “The things we fear the most are often the things we should fear the least. It’s irrational, but it’s what makes us human. And if we’re able to conquer those fears, then there is nothing we’re not capable of.” ([Location 2025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QPHT8CB&location=2025))

### “I am but paper. Brittle and thin. I am held up to the sun, and it shines right through me. I get written on, and I can never be used again. These scratches are a history. They’re a story. They tell things for others to read, but they only see the words, and not what the words are written upon. I am but paper, and though there are many like me, none are exactly the same. I am parched parchment. I have lines. I have holes. Get me wet, and I melt. Light me on fire, and I burn. Take me in hardened hands, and I crumple. I tear. I am but paper. Brittle and thin.” ([Location 2042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QPHT8CB&location=2042))

### Ten minutes later, he wished for death. If Talia had come to him with her shovel, he didn’t think he’d have stopped her. If Lucy had stood above him, eyes blazing, fire burning, he would have welcomed him with open arms. Anything to keep from hiking in the woods.

### Just because you don’t experience prejudice in your everyday doesn’t stop it from existing for the rest of us.” ([Location 2131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QPHT8CB&location=2131))

### “Humanity is so weird. If we’re not laughing, we’re crying or running for our lives because monsters are trying to eat us. And they don’t even have to be real monsters. They could be the ones we make up in our heads. Don’t you think that’s weird?” “I suppose. But I’d rather be that way than the alternative.” “Which is?” “Not feeling anything at all.” ([Location 2435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07QPHT8CB&location=2435))
