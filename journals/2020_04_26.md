## Thoughts::
### 15:34
#### Been a super productive day so far. Just made some eggs because I really haven't had much at all today.

#### Watched another [[YouTube]] video on [[Roam]] this time on [[Daily Template]]'s
##### https://youtu.be/JggEetmfjXk

##### The premise here is to put them on a different page, under the date, so they show up in the references like my logs. 

### 20:27
#### I wonder if there‚Äôs any chance someone will build a tool to upload a [[Roam]] export into [[TiddlyWiki]]. 
##### This would solve all my apprehensions with diving into [[Roam]]. 

##### Did an export on both [[Markdown]] and [[JSON]]. Markdown looks exactly as expected, individual files. Curious what would happen if I uploaded the JSON into a blank TiddlyWiki... for tomorrow. 

#### Another downside of [[Roam]] is the lack of customizability, although I saw there is some CSS stuff you can do (at least I think I did). 

#### Saving [[The Last Dance - ESPN]] for tomorrow. 

#### [[Roam]] is doing this weird thing where, while on mobile, I‚Äôll type [[ and start typing in the closed double bracket, but at some point when I don‚Äôt notice it‚Äôs adding an extra two open brackets so it looks like [[[[]] (with text in the middle obviously.)
##### This is happening when you finish typing the first word after the two brackets and autocorrect adds an extra two for some reason on iOS, for me at least. 

#### I really do like how the logs for watching/reading appear at the end of the day in the references like this. 

### 21:00
#### Want to start exploring and building out plots and outlines for my [[Made Up Movies]]. 
##### First up is [[Mercury Tom]]
