## Background::
### Doing a complete rewatch on [[Netflix]]. watched the first couple seasons when they were happening, but I don’t think I caught the return season or the Yahoo season. 

### Finding out that I only watched S1+2 in their entirety. I remember most of S3, but some of these episodes I missed. Have a suspicion I never even got to S4.
