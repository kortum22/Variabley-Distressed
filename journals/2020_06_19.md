## Semi-not-really-productive day today.

## Woke up at like 5am and shot off an email to [[Saputo]] but then fell asleep again around 7am and didn't get out of bed until 0930am.

## 15 min [[Peloton]] ride.
### Knee hurts still so I didn't want to push it too much.

## [[Jack Baty]] has me thinking a lot about my homepage setup and Daily Notes and Microposts.
### I think I might keep the set-up I have.
#### Microposts blend in so nicely with regular posts my site and the ordering is already to my liking.

### But I have been thinking about having posts that maybe don't hit the RSS feed, akin to Jack's set-up.
#### This way I'd feel more free to push thoughts out like I do here.

#### The problem with this is deciding where things go and when to push and when not to.

#### Overall, I think I'd rather just push everything and if people want to unsubscribe on RSS or unfollow on micro.blog that's fine. 
##### I write for myself anyways.

## I need to get better with the keyboard shortcuts in Roam.
