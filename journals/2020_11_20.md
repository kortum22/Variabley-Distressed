## Final interview for [[CBRE - Job Search]] today went pretty well.
### Will hear back early during the week after Thanksgiving...

## Did a little more unpacking of boxes today. 
### Almost done, but still some stragglers sitting in corners...

### Place is already filled to the brim, not sure what Iâ€™m going to do with the rest of the crap.

### Also, apparently downsizing 33% is having a bigger impact on space than I thought.
#### I never really thought we utilized the old space and a lot of it felt like it was going to waste.
##### A lot of that is also this giant IKEA thing we had that could hold and store so much that fit perfectly in the old place.

## Checked in on [[Air Mail]] again today.
### I donâ€™t know what it is, but something about it entices me. Still not willing to subscribe, but it has the paired down magazine vibe I want, but all digital.

### Real magazines can be overwhelming with what they print/publish and then the whole online thing that they always have to pump out more.
#### I know I donâ€™t have to read everything thing, and trust me, I donâ€™t even get close, but to have that much is still overwhelming.
##### And the delineation between what is in print and whatâ€™s online only frustrates me too.
###### [[The New Yorker]] is better about this aspect, but [[The Atlantic]] is awful.
####### [[The Atlantic]] still doesnâ€™t sync saved stories between devices, which still ticks me off to another level.
