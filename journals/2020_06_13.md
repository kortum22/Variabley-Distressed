## Drinking
### [[Emits Showers of Sparks]]

## Notes
### Getting the new faucet and parts has been a complete pain.

### If [[Roam]] comes out with a mobile app, I may take another look at the paid plan.
#### But until then, I'm all in on [[Obsidian]].

### Put my order in at the store for my [[The Crushed Cave]] ingredients. 
#### Planning brew day for [[2020-06-15]]
