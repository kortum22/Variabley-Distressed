## Getting back to [[Marvel Unlimited]]
### Finished Hickman’s run on [[Avengers]] and [[New Avengers]]. Now it’s time for [[Secret Wars]]. 

## I have started tracking my [[Job Search]] stuff in [[Basecamp]].
### Probably should just do it all here, but I like that I can forward emails, have automated check-ins and a place to post what I've done.
#### With that being said, I still may bring it in here.

### [[Stripe - Job]]

## I feel like I'm never going to get a job.
### Just sitting here toiling my thumbs for nothing all day long.

### Trying to stay productive, but I don't have anything to be

## Today's #[[LoFi]]
### [[Point Pleasant by Brock Berrigan]]

### [[loveless shadows by City Girl]]
