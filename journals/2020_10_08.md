## [[Seattle Move]]
### Got up early for our flight today to look at apartments. 

### Checked out two apartments immediately and then checked into our hotel. 
#### Apartment 1 was super cozy, kind of old school. 

#### Apartment 2 had three units to look at. 
##### 1 was spacious with a balcony. 

##### 2 was a tad smaller but had a cool front patio and private back patio. favorite of the day. 

##### 3 was small, had an absolutely stunning view from the balcony, but there was no division of the balcony with two other units. 

### TK getting some work done before we head to dinner.
