## FUUUUCKKK MOVERS #[[Seattle Move]]
### Still no idea when they are going to get here, just that they went into transit on 11/6 even thought they picked up on 10/23...

### Still sleeping on a floor, and hoping my shit gets here before my interview Wednesday so I can actually shave...

### The movers are coming tomorrow! The movers are coming tomorrow!
#### Already being told of all the extra fees, but at least I’ll have my shit.
