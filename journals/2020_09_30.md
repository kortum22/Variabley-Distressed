## Yesterday was probably an outlier in terms of how much I wrote here. 
### But... I saw [[Phil N.]] mention [[Momento]] and it immediately brought me back. Loved that app. 
#### Looked it up and it still exists, going to check it out. 

#### I feel like [[Day One]] is getting close to nailing that “what happened today” feeling Phil talked about, especially on iPad, but still not the same as Momento and I agree that [[Roam]] doesn’t really serve that either, given how much it fills up and the lack of integration with other places. 

### Also, I love the idea of all the [[Journals/Logs]] I used yesterday, but don’t imagine I’ll keep up with all of them. 
#### Need to make sure I don’t overdo it here and burn out. 

## @muhh wrote some regex for me to replace all ** in my Drafts Roam action for moving links here 👍
### replace(/\*\*/g, "")

## #[[Job Search]]
### Found out one of the people in [[Seattle]] who my cousin connected me with (from his UofW MBA program) a couple months ago has a few high up connections at [[Shelf Engine - Job Search]]. 
#### Shot him an email to see if he knows them well enough to intro me or at least get them to take a close look at my resume. 🤞

#### One of the analysts there has looked at my LinkedIn a few times so I’m hoping I’m at least being considered.

## Considered making a “Sports Log”... 
### Still might do it...

#### I think the criticism of Wallace is a bit unfair. What do you expect him to do? Just end it?
##### They definitely should be on mics that are only on for their two minutes though, but Trump would never agree to that.

#### __It was Donald Trump, taking the building blocks of a democracy and making them unusable for anyone else.__

#### __This was one of Donald Trump’s defining traits—his conviction that the rules, whether they relate to taxes or debate questions or human decency, do not apply to him—playing out in real time.__

#### __If you have no words to offer, absent words become a strategy. If you have nothing to add to the conversation, you might try to exit the conversation. A democracy is, at its core, a discussion; the person leading this one is failing even at the level of dialogue itself.__

### [[📰]] A Disappointed Reader Responds – Waxy.org by Posted September 25, 2020September 25, 2020 by [[Andy Baio]] //250920// [waxy.org](https://waxy.org/2020/09/a-disappointed-reader-responds/)
#### __Right now, those issues just don’t matter very much to me. We’re living in a country facing a badly-mismanaged pandemic that’s killed over 200,000 Americans, a deep distrust of science and the press, the widespread rise of conspiracy theories, racist police violence, an authoritarian takeover of the federal government, a looming election crisis, and a possible civil war.__

#### __As for accusations of bias, I link to articles that are factual and well-researched from authoritative sources and established publications. But I don’t think there’s “another side” to issues like the mishandling of the pandemic, systemic racism, police brutality, climate change, or the Trump administration undermining the election process. It’s the objective truth, and anything else is just spin.__
