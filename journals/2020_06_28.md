## Been a pretty productive day today so far.

## Getting back to using my [[MiniVan]] keyboard.
### It's been so long that I forget a lot of the mappings. And the fact I don't have actual letters or numbers on the keys doesn't help much either.

### Going to take a little bit of time to get used to it again, but I love it so much. Maybe instead of the new iPad Keyboard, I should just get a cable that will hookup to the iPad and try this with a stand and a mouse.

## I don't really have much to write about right now... I want to be filling these daily pages, but everything just seems so samey.

## Watched the first two episodes of [[Hannibal - NBC]]
