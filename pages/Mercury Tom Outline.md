title: Mercury Tom Outline
---

## Act One 
### Opening credits are going to be a super psychedelic but with Saul Bass art animation overtop. 
#### The credits end with a Twilight-esque image (the Shattner plane episode), we see something on the wing, and the wing has a very distinctive green "3".

### That last image should fade until we cut immediately to black and white with Chilton Fuller sitting first class. 

### We see him waking up a bit, but he is in somewhat of a daze, forgetting where he was for a second. His neck is killing him, he has a headache and is in urgent need of coffee.

### He looks around as he gets his grounding and tries to wave down a flight attendant for coffee.

### Once she makes her way back with coffee, he says:
#### You know what.. maybe a couple fingers of whisky as well...

### Has a flashback to a dream of some crazy shit in the desert
#### We later learn this is something that is going to happen in real life later in the moment, so it's something of a flashforward.

### He wakes up

### Takes a cab to his hotel and decides he’s going to try to sleep it off, but the dreams get more intense and we leave the black and white when he wakes up.  

### He tries to go on with his day, first a business meeting, then craps. and flashbacks continue to come in and out. lots of static. quick bursts of black and white interspersed with real life color. 

### The flashbacks and flashforwards and attacks to his head become too mcuh. He starts taking shots and lines of coke

### Cut to black

## Act Two
### Tom wake’s up in the middle of the desert. No memory of how he got there. He lifts his face an inch off the ground, looking around, red sand stuck to his cheek, dropping his head back down out of exhaustion. 

### We cut to black again. 

### Finally, Tom gets off of the ground, the camera raises with him as he checks his pockets to see if there’s anything in them. He finds a some miscellaneous things (think on this as something to use/come back to; first thought was a matchbook, but maybe too cliche)

### With no one around, and being stranded in the middle of knowhere, no idea which direction is home, he picks a way and starts walking.

### As he is walking, he gets flashbacks (intermittedly, slowly revealed as he silently walks) of what he believes are the moments leading up to him ending up in the desert.
#### First we see what we saw earlier, casino, coke, etc., but then it starts to get a bit distorted, it's what we saw before, but there are major differences. Bits of sci-fi are slowly revealed in the corner of the screen, where they weren't seen before, until they become more and more present.
##### Then he just starts to think he is hallucinating, as eventually he is confronted by aliens in these flashbacks who pick him up and eventually drop him off where he woke up in the desert.

### 

## Act Three
### Ends with Tom getting teleported to another planet (Mercury) confronted by an alien tribunal who speaks to him for what feels like forever until he gets transported back. Only he’s older, sitting at a dinner table with people he doesn’t recognize, but sees his face with theirs in photos around the room. 

### Fuller: "I've never seen the sky so full..."

### Alien: "That's because we are in your sky, Mr. Fuller"
