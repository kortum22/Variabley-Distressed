### Location 9
#### Yet Lamott shows that becoming a good writer doesn’t mean just establishing a solid [[Routine]]; it means slowing down, observing your world keenly and looking deep within yourself and your surroundings for material.

### Location 23
#### The best writing is about conveying the truth; the observations you collect will help you to tell it. Whether you believe that your observations will make good material isn’t important. Your main task is to try to find the truth in what you’ve observed, and figure out how to use those observations in the story you want to tell. That way, the truth will naturally find its way into your writing.

### Location 33
#### The only way you can develop your own voice is by being honest with the reader about your true feelings.

### Location 56
#### Write about everything that’s important to you. Only then will you feel connected with your story and be able to find the right words to describe it.

### Location 80
#### It’s important, though, that all writers not only accept the shitty first draft as merely a point of departure, but also embrace this stage of the process.

### Location 81
#### The shitty first draft is the perfect opportunity for you to let your imagination wander and play with ideas. Don’t overthink your writing at this stage–just write. Thinking too much can be counterproductive, blocking your creativity and frustrating you to the point that you may even give up.

### Location 104
#### Remember that dialogue can reveal more about a character than a lengthy description. This doesn’t refer only to what characters say, but also how they say it–their diction, pace and speaking style.

### Location 116
#### Great details can make themselves known at any time, so a good writer keeps her eyes open and carries a notebook at all times to jot down details that may come in handy when writing. But just what sort of details? If you’re at a grandiose mansion for an event, for example, note how many steps there are on the main staircase, or figure out how long it takes to walk from one end of the mansion to the other. Then you can make your wealthy character’s lonely ramblings real.

#### This is how incredibly toxic jealousy is: if you allow it to fester unchecked, it will poison your personality and your writing life.

### Location 181
#### Becoming a good writer means learning to be a good observer, [[Taking Notes]] on everything that happens in your life, and seeking to express the truth. It also requires discipline, which is best nurtured by establishing and sticking to a daily writing [[Routine]]. Once you’re in the flow of writing, don’t be afraid to produce “shitty first drafts,” as this is the most fruitful way to begin a project.
