### Why TikTok duets are the future of music part ✌🏾

A quick 🧵 (w/ videos) 👇🏾 
#### **Note**: Save

### 1/ Duets allows artists (large or small) to put out beats and crowdsource features. 

Let’s start with my favorite @charlieputh. 

He puts out another 🔥 beat and asks for duets. https://t.co/NeNL7mhrvS 

### 2/ Here’s where things get crazy. Earlier I covered how Charlie put out a beat and people basically put together a song. 

Well this time it’s different takes on the same beat. 

Here’s @JUSTUSraps dropping bars on the beat. https://t.co/McDk2IKTWR 

### 3/ And here’s @iamRyanMc slaying some vocals on top of the beat. https://t.co/RIvvWj1f2e 

### 4/ and here’s @wholelottamiles singing and rapping on the beat. https://t.co/t9G5y7HkRv 

### 5/ Now these could be combined into 1 song. 

Or I think they standalone as auditions on the same beat like song covers, but for beats. 

That’s an example of how new song collaboration, artist discovery is changing with Duets. 

But what about existing songs? 

### 6/ For that, let’s take a look at @andygrammer & @jakemiller. Jake puts out a instrumental clip of his hit song Save Me. https://t.co/ed4BS5jwmL 

### 7/ And Andy Grammer duets over his beat adding his amazing voice and lyrics. 

This collab could happen without TikTok, but it’d take flights, calls/texts, managers & more. https://t.co/lT2MzleMtU 

### 8/ Now let’s turn the tables (pardon the pun). @andygrammer puts out a instrumental and gets dueted by @Franciskarel & then Andy reacts to it with a HUGE stamp of approval. https://t.co/OOg1TeOajD 

### 9/ Now, let’s think crossovers. What if @ArianaGrande dropped bars? 

Well here’s @OfficialKristyL going bar for bar AND singing duetting @tokenhiphop.  

The crossovers are endless! https://t.co/Z351RrtP8E 

### 10/ Even nostalgic older songs are being picked up again when big names use them. 

Here’s @charlidamelio vibing to @andygrammer’s 2011 smash hit Keep Ya Head Up. And Andy reacts with some heartfelt BTS of why he wrote the song. https://t.co/g19XYtGurp 

### 11/ The takeaways:

-Duets enable creativity, collaboration & discovery like no other tool before
-Big & small artists benefit from duetting beats. 
-Nostalgia BTS content, song released a decade ago has now gained a new audience 

### BONUS 
Congrats to @MeyersLeonard for making the @NBA finals. Here’s him using a Bollywood singers track for a TikTok. https://t.co/gBxXMRdzmV
