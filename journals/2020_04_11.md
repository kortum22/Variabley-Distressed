## Been using the wiki more this morning. From the [[Wiki]]:
### Starting off the day seeing if saving and syncing will work for me. Going to be more patient before checking from a different browser.

### Note from Chrome iOS didn’t come through after creating this tiddler with safari ios.

### Spinning up both a public [TiddlyWiki](https://wiki.tiv.today/#TiddlyWiki) and a public [Roam](https://wiki.tiv.today/#Roam) at the same time probably isn’t the best idea. I had a private roam for work, but since I’m currently not working it seemed like a good time to have a public one. And now that I can have a [TiddlyWiki](https://wiki.tiv.today/#TiddlyWiki)editable anywhere with [GitHub](https://wiki.tiv.today/#GitHub) thanks to @c the times have collided. Currently typing in [TiddlyWiki](https://wiki.tiv.today/#TiddlyWiki) because it gets input right away from mobile where in [Roam](https://wiki.tiv.today/#Roam) I have to manually open it after typing in the quick input page to have it actually save somewhere. With that being said I still feel I like Roam more and once the iPad magic keyboard comes, it will open Pandora’s box.

### As a test, I threw together a bunch of tiddlers for [2019 Top Tens](https://wiki.tiv.today/#2019%20Top%20Tens) because even if I don’t heavily use this wiki, I feel like the tiddler format just makes sense for housing top ten lists more than something like Roam. And since j never got around to publishing final lists on TIV, they are here now and easily updateable.

### One thing I know I need to avoid is the rigidity I had with Humdrum. It just wore me out.

### Thanks to David @ Blot I’ve gotten on the bandwagon of having posts display in order (oldest to newest) by day (newest to oldest) on the blog.

## Interesting that when I copied over the rich text from the [[Wiki]] it brought the links over with it so I can click into the [[Wiki]]. I guess it's obvious but it surprised me a bit.

## spread out on my floor trying to get all my paper stuff organized. prepping May’s [[Field Notes]], going through my budget and hobonichi’s, looking over April’s budget. trying to make sense of everything. 

## I finished _Kafka on the Shore_ the other day and started _A Darker Shade of Magic_ yesterday. just got notified _Exhalation_ is ready from the library. need to finish _A Darker Shade of Magic_ quickly this weekend so I can get into _Exhalation_ because _The Last Emperox_ comes out April 14, which I preordered for kindle and _The Ocean at the End of the Lane_ is going to become available from my library soon. have to get to reading!
