## Had a second interview with someone at [[CBRE - Job Search]] who is tangentially related to the role. 
### This one didn’t go as well, but hopefully since he is only tangentially related, it doesn’t hamper too much.

## [[Beer Log]]
### [[Space Rex]]

### [[Baked (Peach)]]

## [[Media Diet]]
### [[Atlanta - FX]] S2E3
#### Apparently when I thought I was watching S2 before, but was remembering every episode, it was because Hulu sent me back to S1 after I hit next episode on S2E2...
