### Honestly, haven’t done much else.

## I've been looking for an small e-ink device, maybe the size of an iPhone Plus/Max, to replace my Kindle, but do a little bit more, like be an RSS reader, use as a dedicated podcast device, and if color, read comics on. 
### After some research, the [Poke2 and potentially the "Poke2 Color"](https://blog.the-ebook-reader.com/2020/04/22/onyx-releasing-new-6-poke2-and-poke2-color-ereaders/) seem like they could meet my needs. 6” e-ink screen device that runs Android. Could use Readably to access Feedbin for RSS, Pocket Casts for podcasts, and any number of apps for reading books. $189 for the Poke2, curious to see the price for the color device because ComiXology would be great too.
