## Subscribed to [[Home Normal]] on [[Bandcamp]] to get a shit ton of ambient music to play on my [[Sonos]] while reading and working.
### It was only 25 pounds and I got their entire back catalog plus whatever they release for the next year. 

### I wish [[ChillHop Music]] would have this option as well.
#### Even though Chillhop is on streaming, it's nice to have this kind of music all in one place and immediately get every release.

## Watched the first episode of [[The Great - Hulu]]
