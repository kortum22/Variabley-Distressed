## Super lazy day today. Barely got any sleep last night and the sleep I did get was of exceedingly poor quality. 

## Discovered that [[ChillHop Music]] has subsidiary labels. [[Memoir Music]] is a bit more ambient and relaxed. [[Stereofox]] is another one, I think it has some ambient stuff too, but the [[Bandcamp]] page is very upbeat stuff so Iâ€™m not sure there. 
### And then there are other Channels on [[YouTube]] I found. [[NEOTIC]] [[nourish.]] [[College Music]] [[the bootleg boy]] [[DreamyCow]] still learning this world a bit so Iâ€™m not sure the relation between the channels and who actually owns the music on some of them. Some seem to aggregate music from [[SoundCloud]] where others are almost like an actual record label. 

### Most of the playlist stuff is mostly focused on [[Spotify]], and not [[Apple Music]], which is a huge bummer. 

## My next digital library book is available now so I have to try and wrap up [[The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman]] in the next couple of days so I donâ€™t lose the hold on [[The Ten Thousand Doors of January by Alix E. Harrow]]. I can have more than one book checked out, but I like to give myself the longest period to read, but Iâ€™ll have to check it out by tomorrow night or lose my hold.
