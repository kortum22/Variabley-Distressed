## #[[Made Up Movies]]
### Notes
#### [[July 28th, 2020]]
##### Chilton Fuller - new character name
###### Alex Chilton and Bryan Fuller

##### New potential title: "Never a Fuller Sky"

### Themes:
#### [[July 28th, 2020]]
##### Paranoia, the feeling of being so insignificant (isolated) - a tiny part of the world, waiting for the world to reveal it's true meaning, going through the motions of life realizing no true meaning is going to be revealed, relating to that internal monologue and how you never really truly know how another person feels or is thinking in the moment.

##### In reality, nothing that is happening is really about Fuller, he truly is insignificant, but he was filling the shoes (incorrectly) that someone else was supposed to be in to make sure the environment is aligned.
###### This probably doesn't need to be specifically said, maybe even barely hinted at.

### Inspiration Board: [[Mercury Tom Inspiration Board]]

### Writer
#### Story by: [[David Lynch]] + Script by: [[Drew Goddard]]

### Director
#### [[David Lynch]]

### Star
#### [[Michael Shannon]]

### Score
#### [[Trent Reznor]] & [[Atticus Ross]]

### Plot
#### Man stranded in desert discovers UFO.
##### Thinking he puts himself in the situation though. Something happens in a dream (maybe?) while on an airplane to Las Vegas, which sets him on a course for the desert to discover what it was. 

### Thoughts Behind the Idea
#### So the whole idea started from wanting David Lynch to do something more mainstream and have Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross score it. I thought of this watchingÂ __Eraserhead__, which was just too out there for me. The basic plot thread of a man, stranded, discovering a UFO and crazy shit happening just seemed to fit with the aesthetic of Lynch and Michael Shannon is the perfect person to just have deal with some psychedelic UFO crap in the middle of a desert. Drew Goddard is thrown in the mix to keep things from getting too off the wall. Have Lynch come up with the outline, Goddard script it and add in some quirky meta-ness to the whole thing, then just let Lynch go shoot it.
