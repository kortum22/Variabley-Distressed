## Today’s #[[LoFi]]
### [[On the Rhodes by Mr. Käfer]]

### [[Sandals by Flitz&Suppe, DDob, Mr. Käfer]]

### [[Subway Space by Mr. Käfer, DDob]]

### [[Kingdom in the Blue by Kupla]]
#### much better than the stuff above. 

## Plan::
### DONE Peloton

### DONE PullUps

### DONE Shower

### DONE Read

### DONE Apply for a job (4)

## Nervous to put anything in here right now because I continue to run into issue saving...

## This [[Kickstarter]] from [[Max Temkin]] of [[Cards Against Humanity]] looks pretty cool.
### https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maxtemkin/magic-puzzles/description 

### Unfortunately, I've suspended all extra purchases until #[[The Quarantine Times]] have passed.

## Wanted to do morning pages today, but the sync issues scared me away.

## I'm absolutely awful at finding [[Balance]]. I've been reading more books as of late, but have completely fallen behind on blogs, podcasts, comics, and news. 
### The same can be said for my blog, wiki, [[Roam]], art, notebooks and making photos. 

## Most people on the interwebs seem to be using [[Roam]] for productivity boosts, extensive research, and goal setting/planning, and I'm here logging the shows I watch, getting groceries, and writing a journal... 

## Back on the [[Rick & Morty - Adult Swim]] train with the second half of S4 that premiered last night. 

## Not sure how great this works publicly, but I figured I could try throwing [[Correspondence]] stuff like [[TiddlyWiki]] beginning with the note from [[h0p3]], [[From h0p3: Wax & Wane]]. 
### [[To h0p3: Draft]]

## Started skimming videos on this [[YouTube]] playlist about [[Roam]]. #HowTo
### https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwXSqDdn_CpE934BjXMgmzHnlwXMy41TC

### Will come back to this at some point.
