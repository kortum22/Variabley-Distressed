## Started a fresh session of [[Logseq]] on Chrome, but locally on my MacBook.
### Tried doing a [[Roam]] export of Markdown files and then just dropping them in the journal folder, but since Roam exports as bullets, it comes through jacked up in Logseq.

### Oh Shit! The JSON import worked this time as local.
#### Tried to login to Github to see if it would then sync over, but then I got a blank Logseq...
##### So I tried the JSON import again with Github and still no luck.
###### Oh Shit! Yes it did.
