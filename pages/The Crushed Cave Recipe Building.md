## Think I am going to do something a little different with this recipe now to avoid a Lager yeast, temp issue.

## Going to call it a Chicago Common, even though that probably doesn't mean anything.

## Yeast
### No Longer Going to Use
#### ~~[[Omega German Lager I - OYL-106]]~~
##### Can go up to 68ยบ

#### ~~[[Wyeast Bohemian Lager - WYL-2124]]~~
##### Can also go up to 68ยบ

### [[Omega Kolsh II - OYL-044]]
#### Kolsch strain alternative to ease on temp and layering process.
