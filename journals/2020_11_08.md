## Went to the [[Ballard Farmerâ€™s Market]], which was really nice.
### [[TK]] got some flowers and I grabbed a few cans from [[Tin Dog Brewing]]

## Had to run some errands all over the place as we try to get settled without any of our actual furniture. 
### Got some new bar stools that are nice though.
