### Very much related to yesterdayâ€™s rant...

## Applied to [[Roon]] today...
### Itâ€™s a marketing coordinator position, which I donâ€™t really have a marketing background, but itâ€™s pretty entry level (at this point I really just want a job) and to be able to work there would be pretty cool. It appears to be a lot of Data and Asset management and organization, which is basically what I do with all my shit in my personal life anyways and then coordinating marketing projects, which is what I did on the IT side a bit alongside Sales and Marketing before.

## Trying to cut [[Bruce Wayne]]â€™s nails... not going well...

## The __Supplemental Books__ option in [[Readwise]] is interesting. 
### For paper books, where I donâ€™t want to go back and search through my highlights, it may be worth a try...

### I added [[The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu]] that way, but it looks like itâ€™s only for resurfacing on the Daily Review, it doesnâ€™t get added to your books or sync here. 

## Shouldn't be spending money, but... I saw [[Quip]] has new [refillable floss picks](https://www.getquip.com/store/products/refillable-floss-pick)... not just the floss string packs they came out with before. 
### I already use their toothbrush and use the Reach Flosser, where you have to buy these packs of thirty or so heads to pop on. These look cheaper and like less plastic. 

### Doesnâ€™t hurt that it comes in a cool little pod. 

### Got the plastic pod to save $10 as opposed to the metal one.
