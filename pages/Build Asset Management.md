## About Us:
### The United States is facing a retirement crisis, with four out of five working Americans having less than one year’s income saved in retirement accounts[[1]](). This problem is approaching a tipping point, with 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day over the next 15 years. Whether through a lack of knowledge, a lack of the right investment products, or mistrust in the financial system, working Americans are at risk of not reaching their retirement goals. The retirement savings industry needs innovative investment solutions that inspire investor confidence and make it easy for employers to encourage savings habits that will pay off in positive retirement outcomes.

### At Build Asset Management, LLC, our mission is to narrow the retirement shortfall by giving investors the tools they need to confidently save for retirement. To achieve this we are launching simple, risk-controlled investment solutions that allow investors to select their desired level of asset protection while pursuing upside potential. These solutions can be adjusted to match career stage and savings goals, keeping investors motivated to plan for the long-term and stay invested. We believe these products will give investors a higher degree of quality, confidence, and risk management than what’s available in the industry today. If we succeed, investors will succeed, because they will have the tools they need to build towards a better retirement…until it’s time to start living it.
