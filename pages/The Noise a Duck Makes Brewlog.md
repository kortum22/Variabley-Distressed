## [[May 16th, 2020]] - Night Before
### 17:53 Prepping starter (a little late) for a brew day tomorrow.
#### was also a bit cold still. should be okay because this is a low ABV brew.

#### will also probably only get about 18 hours of starter rather than 24.

### 18:04 5gal and 2.75gal set aside for Mash and Sparge water to air out for tomorrow.

## [[May 17th, 2020]] - Brew Day
### Mash
#### 09:08 Heat started on kettle for mash water.

#### 09:54 Mash salts added at 170º

#### 10:02 Transfer to mash tun started at 190º

#### 10:07 Temp in tun finished transfer at 172º. 
##### Going to give it a minute and then add grains.

#### 10:17 starting to add grains

#### 10:20 grains added temp at ~161º

#### 10:24 Lid closed after stirring and reaching 160º, 60min timer set and starting to heat up sparge in small kettle.

#### 10:53 30min checkin. Mash has already fallen to 154º... Sparge is already up to 180º.

#### 11:16 sealed sparge water away at 180º with 7min left on timer. Mash temp is at 151º...

#### 11:23 Mash timer over at 151º still. Starting vaurlauff.

#### 11:40 9 vaurlauffs, checked sparge temp ~178º, added lactic acid to sparge, and started sparge.

#### 12:16 opened up the valves a little more because the sparge was probably going too slow..

### OG 1.045
#### a little high, but it's an early reading and not at room temp.

### Boil
#### 13:04 started hear on kettle with wort at just over 6gal 130º

#### 14:00 60min timer started a little before boil @ 200º

#### 14:41 1oz Simcoe added (no hopsock) at 18

#### 14:44 chiller added @ 15

#### 14:47 whirlfloc added @ 12

### Post-Boil
#### 15:01 Boil over, 1oz Citra, 1oz Sabro added (no hopsock), and chiller started immediately with cold tap water. Ice to be added to bath shortly.

#### 15:14 15 minute hopstand over, resetting sink with cold water, adding first round of ice, temp @ 120º

#### 15:26 last round of ice added. ~98º

#### 16:07 ~70º, opened valve, transfering to fermentor
##### Note for future [[Homebrew]] [[Lager]], I think if I get a closed stopped I can fit a fermentor in the fridge. I figure I don't need an airlock for cold crash and lagering.

#### 16:15 transfer finished, temp on fermentor says 74º, stirred and swirled for a minute, pitched yeast, and moved to cold closet.

## [[May 20th, 2020]] - First Dry-Hop

### Moved fermentor to warm closet.

## [[May 29th, 2020]] - Cold Crash
### 21:25 - moved the fermentor to the fridge with the silicone bung.

## [[May 30th, 2020]] - Prepped Fermentor after Cold Crash
### 23:30 - moved the fermentor out of the fridge to settle for bottling.

## [[May 31st, 2020]] - Bottling
### Sanitized bucket, tubing, bag, bottles, and caps.

### Transfered to bottling bucket.

### Bottled.

### Left the last bottle, half filled out to condition for a day and try soon.

## [[June 1st, 2020]] - First Sample
### 11:00 - Put first bottle in the fridge.

### [[June 2nd, 2020]]
#### 13:42 - Tried first sample. Not too bad, a little bit of off flavor, which I'm hoping will dissipate
