## Background::

## Quotes::
### The long patrician nose perennially burned by the sun (even in cloudy New York October). (3)

### How can so many things become a bore by middle age—philosophy, radicalism, and other fast foods—but heartbreak keeps its sting? (6)

### one could sit back with a bag of popcorn and watch the romances and comedies of his mind projected onto his face, and the lenses of his tortoiseshell glasses swirled with his thoughts like the iridescent membranes of soap bubbles. (11)

### But once you’ve actually been in love, you can’t live with “will do”; it’s worse than living with yourself. (15)

### Strange, though; because he is afraid of everything, nothing is harder than anything else. Taking a trip around the world is no more terrifying than buying a stick of gum. The daily dose of courage. (45)

### “There follows, I am sad to say, a very long ride on a very slow road…to your final place of rest.” He sighs, for he has spoken the truth for all men. (46)

### scrambled from the sixties onto the mountaintop of the seventies, that era of quick love and quaaludes (is there any more perfect spelling than with that lazy superfluous vowel?), (46)

### His brain sits before its cash register again, charging him for old shames as if he has not paid before. (132)

### Why is everyone so curious about little Arthur Less? When had he ever occurred to any of them before? He has always felt insignificant to these men, as superfluous as the extra a in quaalude. (142)

### “Strange to be almost fifty, no? I feel like I just understood how to be young.” “Yes! It’s like the last day in a foreign country. You finally figure out where to get coffee, and drinks, and a good steak. And then you have to leave. And you won’t ever be back.” (153)

### We all recognize grief in moments that should be celebrations; it is the salt in the pudding. (193)

### Like a landmark, a pyramid-shaped stone or a cypress, that we assume will never move. So we can find our way home. And then, inevitably, one day—it’s gone. And we realize that we thought we were the only changing thing, the only variable, in the world; that the objects and people in our lives are there for our pleasure, like the playing pieces of a game, and cannot move of their own accord; that they are held in place by our need for them, by our love. (256)
