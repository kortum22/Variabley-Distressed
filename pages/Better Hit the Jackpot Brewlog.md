## #[[Brew Log]]

## Night Before - [[April 15th, 2020]]
### Did a little bit of house cleaning, making sure I have everything. Set out 5+ gal of water in one kettle and another 2+ gal of water for sparging in a second kettle.

### Yeast went into a starter on Tuesday afternoon, so that should be plenty ready before brewing.

## Brew Day - [[April 16th, 2020]]
### 09:15 - waiting until 10:30 to start boil to time it so the stove is free when I need to make some lunch.

### 10:30 AM - Heat started on mash water

### 11:00 AM - Salts added to mash water (scale doesn't work great at the gram level. going back to measuring at the tsp next time)

### 11:30 AM - Transferred water over to the mash tun once it hit 190º -> 180º once it hit finished the transfer.

### 12:10 PM - Temp fell to 170º and 60 MIN timer started after adding the grains -> 160º. Left lid off for a little bit to help the temperature fall. Started heating the sparge water.

### 12:18 PM - Temp still a little high, but put the lid on anyway to make an errand run @ 158º.

### 1:38 PM - Sparge started with 168º water after ten vaurlauffs to clear out the wort. Mash was down to 145º by the time I started sparging.

### 2:00 PM - Sparge ran out too quick, mash still emptying.

### 6:15 PM - transferred to fermentor and pitched yeast. Put in cold closest and will move to the warmer closet in a few days.

## [[April 18th, 2020]]
### Had to switch over to some blow-off tubing due to over-fermentation.

## [[April 23rd, 2020]]
### Moved the fermentor to my warmer closet after the first week. ~72° vs ~67°

## [[April 27th, 2020]]
### Added 1/2 gallon of grape juice. Fermentation is kicking back up again. Will aim to add dry hop additions on Thursday for a week before bottling.

## [[April 29th, 2020]]
### No changes today. Just checking in. 

### Fermentation has slowed down significantly after the grape juice addition has converted. 

### Planning to add my dry-hops tomorrow. 

### DONE Should be ready to bottle next Thursday [[May 7th, 2020]]

## [[April 30th, 2020]]
### 12:35 Dry-hops of 1oz [[Strata]] and 1oz [[NZH-107]] added and stirred in with sanitized spoon.

## [[May 6th, 2020]]
### 14:57 Not sure if I am going to bottle tomorrow. Still getting a couple bubbles. This happened last time around with [[Sir Stone Age, King of the Vibes]], so it might be ready. Or I might give it another couple of days.

## [[May 7th, 2020]]
### DONE Bottle Beer

### 15:43 Currently cleaning up after bottling.

### Boiled 2 cups of water with 4.85oz of dextrose priming sugar.
#### After it cooled a little bit, I added two little packets of grape crystal light (meant for 16.9oz bottles each) to the priming solution to assist with some grape flavor.

### Transferred beer to bottling bucket with hop bag wrapped around tubing to filter out any trub.

### Bottling went successfully.

### **Final OG 1.010**
#### High due to grape juice and grape crystal light additions I assume.

## [[May 24th, 2020]]
### Bottles put into fridge.
