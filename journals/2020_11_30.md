## I guess itâ€™s time to start being productive again...

## Shit... [[Phil N.]] mentioned some [[Obsidian]] stuff. 
### https://roamresearch.com/#/app/twelvety_public/page/QUxzN8lZN

### Very intriguing... might have to look again...

### Mobile is still my biggest struggle though...
#### Still on the roadmap as long term. 

### And I know thereâ€™s an outliner plugin, but doubt itâ€™s as smooth as Roam. 
#### I could very well be wrong though. 

## Need to be productive today. 
### Loaded up Things with all the small things I want to get done. 

### Still been pretty lazy...

## Cut my hair for the first time in awhile today.
