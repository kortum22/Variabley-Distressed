## Today's #[[GIF]] ![](https://media1.giphy.com/media/UQn7q0Z85koZhsXwHm/giphy.gif?cid=4d1e4f29ee7c0571d5e7dbd731a2d0bac1c1f31091feda27&rid=giphy.gif)

## Today's #[[LoFi]]
### [[The Finish Line by Middle School]]

## Playing around with some [[TiddlyWiki]] stuff. Someone made an importer to go from [[Roam]] to [[TiddlyWiki]]. It works pretty great. The only downside is losing tags with a hashtag rather than links. But importing pulled everything in and the backlinks work perfectly with TiddlyBlink still with no problem. 
### Might have to avoid using hashtags and just use them as links.

## Was watching more [[YouTube]] videos on [[Roam]], people seem to be way over-complicating things, causing more work. 

## Starting to go through and convert hashtags to hashtags with brackets so the import into [[TiddlyWiki]] works better with [[TiddlyBlink]].
### It's not that I plan on moving over to [[TiddlyWiki]], but that seems more future-proof than relying on a SaaS that could die.
