## I hope [[Safari]] 14 and the [[mymind]] extension means we might get some [[Safari]] compatible [[Roam]] extensions now too.

### Still mostly sticking with my [[iTunes]] and [[Bandcamp]] libraries, but it's useful to be able to listen to new stuff.

### Still think the playlists mixing podcasts and music are weird... 
#### Giving the Daily Wellness one a shot though...
##### Meh

## With a move-in date confirmed in [[Seattle]], Iâ€™m starting to plan my next [[Homebrew]].

### Thinking of a pseudo lager style beer with some lemon and lime zest. 
#### [[Pseudo SuperSonic]]

#### Well I think Iâ€™ve come up with the perfect first beer to brew once Iâ€™m in Seattle. Blending Omegaâ€™s [Pseudo-Lager](https://omegayeast.com/lutra-kveik-helles-pseudo-lager-recipe) recipe and their Lutra Kveik yeast with a Nano NEIPA, then adding some lemon and lime zest in boil, __Pseudo SuperSonic__ is born.

### Trying to pull some useful things I could do around here. 

### Want to implement some sort of review and on this day (although this isnâ€™t that old yet.)
#### Could potentially do a daily review under the link log everyday or just a weekly one on Sundays. 
##### Could use block references for all top level blocks from the day before if daily, if weekly, probably just review each day at a high level. 

#### For on this day, Iâ€™m curious if a query would work to pull in every October 1 from every year.
##### Donâ€™t think it would work now, but maybe as it is developed more. 

##### This does get me thinking if I should be tagging days with the day and date to make something like this more doable down the road. 
###### I think [[Phil N.]] did this a couple times, but it looks like he gave up on it pretty quickly. 

### Hoping to do a deeper dive through these tomorrow.
