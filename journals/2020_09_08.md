## Have a lot I need to get done today.

## Been a little depressed lately.
### Between the job search, listing the condo (which I imagine is going to take forever to sell), being home all day, not having a sense of purpose, dealing with the cars, everything is just weighing me down and I don’t really know how to handle it all.

### I’m trying my best to get into routines, but a lot of the things I like to do cost money and I just don’t have any right now.

## Finished [[Annabel Scheme by Robin Sloan]]

## Watched [[Raised by Wolves - HBO]] S1E1

## Two showings scheduled at the condo already. 
### One for tomorrow morning and one for Thursday morning!
