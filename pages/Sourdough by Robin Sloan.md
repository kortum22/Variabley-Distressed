## Background::
### Probably one of my favorite books ever. I read [[Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore by Robin Sloan]] shortly after.

### Discovered Sloan through the [[FSG x MCD]] newsletter [[Electric Eel]] when he did a guest post about the [[Anime]] [[Skull-face Bookseller Honda-san]].

## Quotes::
### "Here’s a thing I believe about people my age: we are the children of Hogwarts, and more than anything, we just want to be sorted."

### "Greatest among us are those who can deploy “my friend” to total strangers in a way that is not hollow, but somehow real and deeply felt; those who can make you, within seconds of first contact, believe it."

### "The internet: always proving that you’re not quite as special as you suspected."

### "I pushed a few logs inside, arranged them in a loose triangle, tucked some kindling into place, and lit my first fire. It smoked and fumed. A lick of flame appeared, inspected its nest, proclaimed it satisfactory, and began to crackle."

### "The air was heavy and cold, and when I looked up, I saw a surprise. The oven’s heat, rising in a steady plume, had bored through the fog and cleared a channel to the sky. I saw stars."

### "Some mornings, the repetition felt Zen-like; others, Sisyphean. But in either case, it felt good to use my arms, not my fingertips. My nose, not my eyes."

### "The woman was passing around a platter stacked with blocks of apparently edible matter. Each was wrapped in silvery-green paper, but the matter itself was as white as a grub. The blocks resembled ghostly Rice Krispies Treats."

### "I’ll attach the album. I like some of the tracks more than others (it gets oonce-y…), but mostly, I’m proud of my brother for making something that’s truly his."

### “In that cave, empires are rising and falling. There are battles under way. Wars. More soldiers on both sides than in all the wars of human history combined. And they are struggling. They are taking territory, making it safe. Building fortresses.” He lifted the wheel he’d chosen out of his basket and hefted it. “There is a saga in here to put our whole history to shame.”

### "you can teach me, I can teach the Vitruvian, and then those skills can be shared in a new way, thanks to my former employer. The world is going to change, I think—slowly at first, then faster than anyone expects. It’s going to be a weird time, but along the way I think I can get rich. We can get rich."
