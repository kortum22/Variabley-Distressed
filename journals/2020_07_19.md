## Was supposed to get dinner with my mom today, but she isn't feeling well now so instead I am going to pick her up some panera  for lunch.

## Getting back to [[Billions - Showtime]] now that we have a [[Showtime]] trial. 

## Spent a good amount of time going through [[Bandcamp]] and downloading tracks. 
### Using [[Roon]] at the moment, but not sure Iâ€™ll keep it around because of cost.
