## Honestly, not sure how I feel about the [[Readwise]] auto imports...

## Got a lot done today. 
### Brought car in to fix the scratch/dent in the door before we make out drive to Seattle soon. 
#### [[TK]] thought I should wait, but I like this shop and just wanted to get it done before the move. 

### Signed a bunch of lawyer documents for the [[Condo Sale - Winchester]]. 
#### Appraisal from buyers lender is coming tomorrow morning too. Starting to feel like his loan might actually come through. 

#### Leak issue is driving me crazy. 
##### One of the two things the buyer asked for was getting the association to fix a leak. 
###### No leak exists! And I donâ€™t know why they keep coming back with this. 

### Picked up three(!) new [[Hop Butcher for the World]] beers, all new releases. Only bought singles to try and save some money though. 
#### [[Lager Beer Hall]]

#### Also got some non-HB brews (can of each):
##### Gaudy Apartment Complex from [[Liquid Love]] a relatively new brewery from the burbs. 
###### https://untp.beer/vANQ8

##### Expanding Symmetry from [[Saint Errant]]
