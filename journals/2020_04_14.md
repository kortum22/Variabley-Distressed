## Been really enjoying the [[TiddlyWiki]] right now, especially now that I've enabled [[TiddlyBlink]] to make it more like [[Roam]]. 
### [[TiddlyBlink]] isn't as responsive when trying [[ to bring up different references though, which at times as been frustrating.

## Loaded up my homebrews on [[TiddlyWiki]] to go along with my [[Top Ten]] Lists from last year and my [[Made Up Movies]]

## At a standstill where to put things. Even through all of the old rendition of [[Humdrum Life]], I've never felt as close to Jack and Phil in their struggles with places for text as I do now.
