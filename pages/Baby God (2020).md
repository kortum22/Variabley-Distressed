### Rating: 2/5

### Year: #2020

## Thoughts:
### Wasn’t really interested in watching this, but [[TK]] wanted to.

### In the end, it was pretty boring. 
#### They left the most interesting aspects to the very end, but the way they cut some of the interviews to leave that for the end felt forced and unjustified.

## About w/ Spoilers:
### It’s about some fertility doctor who used his own sperm to inseminate women.

### Also apparently molested his kids.
#### And inseminated his step-daughter with his own semen..

### Yeah, kind of fucked up.
