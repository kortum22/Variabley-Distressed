## Started writing a short story before, never got to it. reusing it as an opening scene setup here:
### After hours of uncomfortable slumber, neck wrecked to the left, I awoke in a daze remembering where I was, in First Class (although it felt like the flight attendants forgot this fact), on a flight to Las Vegas. A slight headache, from a lack of caffeine, delayed my motions, still getting my grounding. I turned to the window, opening the shade, and looking out at the wing with a green number three written in some boring typeface. 

### It was then I saw an orange light out into the distance. Getting closer and closer until I realized this was the end. I closed my eyes tight, embraced, and... waited?

### Nothing happened. Until a migraine hit me without a moments notice in perfect timing with when the light would’ve reached through the window and tapped me on the forehead. Well that’s a slight exaggeration given I woke up with a slight headache, but this was like nothing I had ever experienced before. It took all the willpower I had to stop from screaming and disturbing (and most likely, freak the fuck out of) everyone around me. it was as if a literal stick of dynamite exploded within my skull. My brain was no more. My eyes were out of their socket. Tongue burnt to a crisp. 

### I eventually regained a bit of normalcy between the ears and immediately asked the flight attendant for a whisky. I guess we were getting close to landing based on the side eye glance I received back, but she obliged and came back, setting a glass down with two fingers of shitty whisky. I guess I should have been more specific. 

### A few sips in and I got this sinking feeling in my gut. I started to see glimpses of the desert, almost like a memory of looking out the plane window.
