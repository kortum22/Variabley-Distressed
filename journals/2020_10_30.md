## Clear. To. Close!!!! #[[Condo Sale - Winchester]]
### Last minute, but that’s all that matters. 

### Walk through at 2, closing at 3.

### Closed. What a relief.

## Just did a digital interview for [[CBRE - Job Search]] where I had to answer five questions typed out and then eight where I recorded myself speaking into the camera and answering the questions.
### Weird.

### Think I did okay.
#### There was definitely one I didn’t feel like I had a great answer for and then maybe in one or two I definitely flubbed some words.
