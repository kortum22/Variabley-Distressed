### [[📰]] Stop Calling [[Breonna Taylor]]’s Killing a ‘Tragedy’ by [[Jemele Hill]] //290920// [www.theatlantic.com](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/tragedy-means-blaming-black-people/616528/)

### [[🎙]] The Unexpected and Unpredictable {{{alias [[LosAngelesLakers]]Lakers}}} vs. {{{alias [[MiamiHeat]]Heat}}} NBA Finals, Plus: [[Doc Rivers]] Is “Out” With the {{{alias [[LosAngelesClippers]]Clippers}}} | [[The Mismatch]] — [[The Ringer NBA Show]] — Overcast //// [overcast.fm](https://overcast.fm/+GgJBr0rWg)
#### Playing around with alias’ here. Not as great as I’d want it to be.
##### Hopefully this is something that improves.

##### Kind of dumb that having a link or alias breaks the markdown bolds.

### [[📹]] Is It Too Late To Stop [[Climate Change]]? Well, it's Complicated. - [[YouTube]] [[Kurzgesagt]] //// [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbR-5mHI6bo&feature=share)
#### While they do well to not be pessimistic, I still come away super fucking depressed from it.

### [[📰]] Can Podcasts Improve Our Well-Being? by [[Alexandra Schwartz]] //280920// [www.newyorker.com](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/10/05/can-podcasts-improve-our-well-being)

### [[📰]] [[Donald Trump]] Barely Pays Any Taxes: Will Anyone Care? by [[David Remnick]] //280920// [www.newyorker.com](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/donald-trump-tax-returns-irs-750-dollars)

### [[📰]] Judge Excoriates Epic’s Dishonesty in Hearing Regarding Lawsuit Against Apple //// [daringfireball.net](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/09/29/epic-dishonesty)
#### I know it’s not popular to defend a large company like [[Apple]] that doesn’t need defending, but I think the judge nailed it here based on the quotes [[John Gruber]] shared here. 

### [[🎙]] [[Jeff Van Gundy]] on the [[NBA Finals]] — [[The Lowe Post]] — Overcast //// [overcast.fm](https://overcast.fm/+d1thI-qYY)

## Updated a bunch of my [[Siri Shortcuts]] and [[Drafts ]] Actions to send links, media, movies, etc. to a Roam workspace in Drafts. These were already running to update their respective pages on [[TIV]], now I’m a simple copy paste from getting them into [[Roam]] as well.

## Worried my [[Condo Sale - Winchester]] is going to fall through. 
### Have a potential second offer I can take, but at a little less of a price. Going to try to ride the first offer through for the time being, hoping their financing doesn’t disappear (they have until [[October 16th, 2020]] to clear for closing) and then if they do, hopefully the second offer is still around... 

### I hate this...

### Not to mention the pain of dealing with movers for a cross-country move.
#### I’ve talked to a couple, some just seem super sketchy.
##### Some of them will literally call me multiple times a day, every day.

#### Luckily, it sounds like it will cost half of what my fiancé was givin from her company so we basically have a down payment for our [[Seattle]] apartment ready, whenever we find one and can move...

## It’s a huge bummer that when you save a story in [[The Atlantic]] app, it doesn’t sync across devices.
### I’m often scrolling through the **Latest** tab, saving stories, and then want to read them on my iPad. This works almost perfectly in [[The New Yorker]] app, although they don‘t have a **Latest** tab, which is a bummer itself.

## [[Politics Journal]]
### Really not looking forward to the [[Presidential Debate]] tonight for the [[2020 Presidential Election]]
#### At this point, I really don’t feel like any good can actually come from it. 

### Holy shit... this might be worse than I expected.

### Biden started out slow, especially his first answer about Obamacare, but I feel like he has found a bit of a stride.

### Trump is just so fucking ridiculous.
#### [[Phil N.]] [on Trump tonight](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/twelvety_public/page/ICwuHSP8O)
##### __11:14 PM: Well, what did we expect? Trump had diarrhea and we all crowded around the toilet bowl for a front row seat.__
###### Couldn’t have said it better myself. 

### This is one of the most infuriating experiences in my life.

## [[Media Diet]]
### [[Utopia - Amazon]] S1E1

### [[Bird by Bird - Blinkist]]

## [[TIV Log]]
### Looking for some Drafts scripting help: is it possible for a single line to remove all instances of “**”? See screenshot below, each line in the red circle removes one instance, but I’m hoping to be able to remove all instances without knowing how many there are… ![](https://tiv.today/_Images/2020/draftscriptunbold.jpeg)

### Did the world just end..? What did I just watch..? Please, please vote…

## [[Beer Log]]
### [[The Jewels]]

### [[Dovetail Vienna Lager]]
#### Needed a second beer after putting myself through the first [[Presidential Debate]]
