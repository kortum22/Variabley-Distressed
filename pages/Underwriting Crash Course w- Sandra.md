## Insurance Technology

## A lot going on (this is good)

## 

## Different types of insurance carriers
### personal lines (state farm) - standard

### personal and commercial (travelers, liberty mutual) - standard

## Paper - person who takes the risk (backing the risk)
### Paper companies - State farm has 10 different paper companies

## Underwriting - different levels - accessing risk and managing p&l
### typical is automated and looked at from a portfolio basis

### Sandra is specialized, only 10 accounts 
#### Sell and prospect to brokers and clients, get deals in

## Underwriter is with insurance company, broker is in between client 

## E&S - (Excess & Surplus) difficult to price (vs Standard Market)

### Unregulated paper

### Have to have three declarations from the standard market

### Take a ton of different risks, high severity.
#### If something happens, it'll be terrible, but not frequent.

### So much less predictable.

### Same concept as regular insurance, but scarier, bigger.

### Different ways to access: broker, or broker may go to wholesaler.

## MGA - Managing General Agent

### insurance company agrees to give their paper to a different underwriting company

## Someone else will actually financially back Griffin's underwriting.
### Bigger insurance companies 

## There is so much transferring of data, client -> broker -> us (MGA) -> underwriting/paper company

## 40+ different lines of coverage
### Property, Aviation, Workers Comp, Directors and Officers (Enron, penalties paid by company, damages (lawsuits) paid by insurance)

### 15-20 just in businesses

## So much data stored in weird places, hard to insert a new system.

## ^^Trying new systems, building internal systems, how advanced, where are you with your systems, have you been using them forever?^^

## Tons of Insurtech companies out there.
