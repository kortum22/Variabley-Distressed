## Woke up pretty late today. 

## 20 min [[Peloton]] ride

## EPL is back today. 
### Going to watch the [[Manchester City]] vs. [[Arsenal]] game. 
#### City won 3-0

## I want my blog to be a little more like my [[Roam]] plus [[Warren Ellis]] LTD and a bit of [[Dave Winer]] scripting.com

## Focused on [[Notifications]] today.
### Trying to scrub them from my iPad and iPhone so only critical stuff comes up.

### Don't want this to mean I miss the non-critical though. Need to try to find a balance for myself.

## Started [[Becoming by Michelle Obama]]
