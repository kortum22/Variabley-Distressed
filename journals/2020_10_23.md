## 07:47 - Movers have arrived #[[Seattle Move]]

### They get you with with all the fees apparently...

### Probably going to be an extra grand..
#### Extra $1,500..........

### Should still be okay though.

## I feel like they didnâ€™t even use the mute capability last night...

## Did a blind taste test of three different unflavored 1L glass bottles of sparkling water. San Pellegrino vs. Topo Chico vs. Mountain Valley. Topo Chico was by far and away my favorite and San Pellegrino was surprisingly my least favorite.

### Wanted to do Perrier but they didnâ€™t have single, unflavored glass bottles. 

## Just four days before we hit the road for [[Seattle]], Iâ€™ll be able to try my 100th unique [[Hop Butcher for the World]] beer. In a surprising twist itâ€™s a red IPA @ 6.66% AbV called [[Satanâ€™s Mile]]. Feels like a bad omen...

## Apparently someone signed my Gmail up for updates from the tangerine toupee. Luckily, Google is smart enough to send that shit to Junk. 

## I miss using my [[Peloton]]... 

## Planning a wedding (still pretty far out), moving to Seattle, and trying to find a job while unemployed, all at the same time, is brutal. Mentally and emotionally.

## I donâ€™t really know what [[Beam]] is other than the fact itâ€™s a [[Note-Taking App]] made apparently by ex-[[Apple]] people and that [[Jack Baty]] mentioned it and signed up for the beta waitlist.

### This was enough for me to sign-up, obviously, but it almost feels like some Apple guys saw [[Roam]] get a shit ton of money and said we can build something a little prettier and more Apple-y. 

### As far as I can tell, thereâ€™s no screenshots, video, or anything of what it will look like, do, or feature types. Just a vague write-up... 

## No more [[Mindhunter - Netflix]]...

### What a bummer. Was really excited for a third season.

### Might have been my favorite [[Netflix]] show.
