## [Omega Site](https://omegayeast.com/yeast/lagers/german-lager-i)

## Versatile, crisp, malty profile, light esters and a wide fermentation range, German Lager I is thought to be the world’s most used lager strain and can produce a convincing lager at ale temperatures. Fermenting in the low temperature range (45-55° F), it maintains a more crisp profile. Temperatures higher in range (65-68° F) bring out slightly heightened esters. Rest for diacetyl.
