## Looking into the cost of [[NBA]] [[League Pass]]. 
### Realized I wonâ€™t be able to watch [[Chicago Bulls]] games now that Iâ€™m in [[Seattle]]. 
#### Although, maybe I can get [[Portland Trailblazers]] games on local tv. 
##### This would be cool. A much better team anyways. 

### Pricing isnâ€™t in the app yet, not sure if things will change given the complications with the new season. 
#### Website lists it at $29/month for all teams and $18/month for a single team.
