### I'm curious how a diehard republican/trumper would answer the question, "What's a situation you think Trump has handled poorly in his time in office?" A large part of me thinks the majority of the diehards would say "Nothing," and it freaks me out. A lot. Even the most diehard Obama fan has criticisms, because no one, not even Trump is perfect. And the great thing is, I believe Obama truly welcomed criticism. Obviously, not the belligerent talk or the birtherism bullshit, but about policy and how he has handled situations because he is someone who actually cares about doing his best and helping people. With Trump, he and his followers seem to think he is perfect in every respect and has never done anything wrong. Even with all the bullshit he has done, this is the worst aspect of him. Rant over.

##### Absolutely brutal headline, but it gets to the point.

### I was thinking about [[Podcasts]] and how occasionally, I'll listen to them while doing something else, not just walking or driving, but actually completing tasks, working, etc. and how I still find value in that listening. At times, it can be white noise in the background, other times, it can give me a quick break from what I'm working on, until I feel the motivation to work again, with the podcast becoming white noise again. Oftentimes, while listening, I'll zone out in my own head, thinking about a topics, usually spurred by something that was said in the podcast, leading me off in to my own tangential brain space. These are thinking moments for me, whether working, walking, cleaning, etc. I find this time extremely valuable, even if I'm missing a part of my favorite podcast as I dive deeper into my head.

### Having a place to write that is as frictionless as [[Roam]], where I don't have to wrroy about editing or how it reads, or if it makes me look like an idiot, makes actually blogging even more challenging because I always come here first, get it down, and never go back or even start to write anything for the blog...

## Episodes 7&8 have probably been my favorite so far on [[The Last Dance - ESPN]] the drama, the storytelling, the events already ingrained in my memory through retellings heard and read in the past.
