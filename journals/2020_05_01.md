## Today’s #[[LoFi]]
### [[Ambedo by Toonorth]]

### [[Long Story Short by Toonorth]]

#### This album is really good. 

## Finished [[Watchmen]] today, although I still have a little bit of the backmatter I want to read before giving this back. 

## Had some time in the car as a passenger and started adding info to some movie pages. 

## Been a little mopey and down in the dumps the last two days. Not sure why...

## [[The New Yorker]] article on #[[LoFi]] and [[ChillHop Music]] from #[[2019]]
### [Against Chill: Apathetic Music to Make Spreadsheets To](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/against-chill-apathetic-music-to-make-spreadsheets-to)
#### Quotes::
##### They found the question silly if not fatuous—the music wasn’t really for liking, in the traditional sense. The music wasn’t for anything. It merely existed to facilitate and sustain a mood, which in turn might enable a task: studying, folding laundry, making spreadsheets, idly browsing the Internet.

##### The video featured an animated raccoon wearing a peach hoodie and drinking a cup of coffee, in a dorm room strewn with generational signifiers: houseplants, seltzer, a turntable. Every once in awhile, the raccoon started typing or casually flicked its tail. Benign electronic music played. I found that the song evaded precise description—perhaps by design—so I free-associated on my notepad: koi pond, medical-grade marijuana, boutique hotel, hot-stone massage, European airplane, cool dentist.

##### Background music is hardly a new development, but, previously, these sorts of experiences were mostly relegated to elevators and waiting rooms; now the groundless consumption of music has become omnipresent.
###### My Note: Classical music has been used in a similar vain for a very long time. People use it both to listen to intently, as well as background study music. Jazz as well.
