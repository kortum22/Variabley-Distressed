## Had a dream that I switched to [[TheBrain]]... weird...
### I most likely will have to switch to Obsidian once Roam starts charging me though... 
#### And then I’ll have to figure out what to do if I still want these types of things to be public. 

## Finally got motivated enough to shower before noon and get the grocery shopping done and pick up some beans from the coffee shop...

## Cleared out a bit of RSS and newsletters this morning. 
### Most were skims so not included in the link log. 

## [[Big Mail]]
### https://getbigmail.com/

### It’s nice looking, but this is the kind of style I’m not really a fan of.
#### Also just seems like a coat of polish over the stuff Gmail actually already does.
##### Maybe there’s a bit more to it, incorporating new senders and all, but I don’t know that I need to move away from [[Hey]].
###### Cost is probably less though...

## So many job apps today.
### A bit depressed I didn’t hear back from [[CBRE - Job Search]]
#### Was really hoping I would get this job so the misery would end.

#### They said I’d hear back first week of December. 
##### I assumed that meant this week, but maybe since Monday was technically November they meant next.......?

#### Gonna be really fucked if I don’t find something soon.

## [[Jack Baty]] had mentioned something to [[Phil N.]] about using less links in Roam, and lately I’ve gone all in on just linking everything.
### I’ll probably regret it, but I think it would be cool, especially if I ever have the motivation to put my thoughts in the link logs, about seeing every time someone or something was mentioned. 

### I’m not really using it as a research tool, but as a diary/journal/log so being able to look back interests me.
#### And no, I have yet to look back through anything or even make use of the references, except for some small instances with media.
##### This is partly due to a super lack of motivation on my part, but probably more just because it’s not something I’d actually do maybe... 🤷‍♂️
