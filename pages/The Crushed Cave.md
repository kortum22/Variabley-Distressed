#### Ingredients:
##### MASH INGREDIENTS - PRE BLENDED
· 5 lbs Weyermann Barke Vienna Malt
· 3 lbs Weyermann Barke Pilsner Malt
· 2 lbs Weyermann Barke Munich Malt
· 0.13 lbs Weyermann Dehusked Carafa II
BOIL ADDITIONS & TIMES
· 1 oz German Hallertau (60 min)
· 1 oz German Hallertau (10 min)
YEAST
Dry Yeast:
· Fermentis Saflager W-34/70. Optimum Temp: 48°- 68°F
Liquid Yeast Options:
· Imperial Yeast L13 Global. Optimum temp: 46°- 56°F
· Omega OYL - 106 German Lager I. Optimum temp:
45°- 68°F
· Wyeast 2124 Bohemian Lager. Optimum temp: 45°- 68°F

#### Instructions:
##### If you are new to all-grain brewing, we suggest starting with 1.5 quarts of water per pound of grain for the strike water volume. This mash thickness can be adjusted for future brews as you become more comfortable with your equipment.
· Saccharification Rest: 150°F for 60 minutes
· Mashout: 170°F for 10 minutes (optional) - to raise the
temperature for mashout, gently apply direct heat while stirring well (only with a kettle-based mash tun!), or add near boiling water until the target temperature is reached.
Prepare sparge water in your hot liquor tank at a rate of 2 quarts per pound of grain in the recipe, and perform a fly sparge until you have gathered your pre-boil volume (6-7 gallons) in your boil kettle. The sparge should take about an hour for optimal extraction efficiency. You should end up with extra sparge water in your hot liquor tank, you can use this hot water for cleaning later on.

##### This recipe calls for a 60 minute boil duration.
· 1 oz German Hallertau (beginning of the boil)
· 1 oz German Hallertau (10 minutes remaining in the boil)

#### Steps:
##### Cool the wort: When the 60 minute boil is finished, cool the
wort to 50° - 60°F as rapidly as possible.


##### Sanitize fermenting equipment and yeast packs: While the
wort cools, sanitize the fermenting equipment - fermenter, lid or stopper, airlock, funnel, etc - along with the yeast packets.


##### Transfer your cooled wort into the primary fermentation vessel using a valve on the boil kettle, by siphoning from the boil kettle, or pouring the wort into the fermenter.


##### Place the fermenter and yeast packets in your intended
fermentation area for a few hours to allow temperatures to
stabilize. Please note that this is a lager fermentation and
temperature control is critical.


##### Aerate the wort. Seal the fermenter and rock back and forth
to spash for a few minutes, or use an aeration system and
diffusion stone.


##### Measure specific gravity of the wort with a hydrometer and
record in the "BREWER'S NOTES" section. Target gravity for
this kit is 1.050.


##### Add your yeast once the temperature of the wort is between 50° - 60°F. Sanitize and open the yeast packs and carefully pour the contents into the primary fermenter.


##### Seal the fermenter. Add approximately 1 tablespoon of
sanitizer or clean water to the sanitized airlock. Insert the
airlock into the rubber stopper or bucket lid and seal the
fermenter.

##### Active fermentation begins. Within approximately 48 hours of Brewing Day, active fermentation will begin – there will
be a cap of foam on the surface of the beer, the specific
gravity as measured with a hydrometer will drop steadily, and you may see bubbles come through the fermentation lock. The optimum fermentation temperature for this beer is 50° - 60°F, move the fermenter to a warmer or cooler spot as needed.

##### Active fermentation ends. Approximately one to two weeks
after brewing day, active fermentation will end. When the cap of foam falls back into the new beer, bubbling in the air lock slows down or stops, and the specific gravity as measured with a hydrometer is stable, proceed to the next step

##### Transfer beer to secondary fermenter. Sanitize siphoning
equipment and an airlock and carboy bung or stopper. Siphon the beer from the primary fermenter into the secondary. Place the fermenter in a refrigerator for the lagering process. If you do not have a secondary fermenter, simply leave the beer in the primary fermenter and place in a refrigerator.

##### Allow the beer to condition (lager) in the refrigerator for 4
weeks before proceeding to the next step. Timing is now
somewhat flexible. *See the "YOU WILL NEED" section
and Step 11.


##### After 4 weeks, remove the beer from the refrigerator and allow to rest at room temperature for 2 to 3 days before bottling. This is called a diacetyl rest and will help to reduce any possible off-flavors.

##### Sanitize siphoning and bottling equipment.


##### Mix a priming solution (a measured amount of sugar
dissolved in water to carbonate the bottled beer). Use the
following amounts, depending on which type of sugar you
will use:
· Corn sugar (dextrose) 2/3 cup in 16 oz water.
· Table sugar (sucrose) 5/8 cup in 16 oz water.
Bring the solution to a boil and pour into the bottling bucket.


##### Siphon beer into bottling bucket and mix with priming
solution. Stir gently to mix—don’t splash.


##### Fill and cap bottles.

##### Condition bottles at room temperature for 2 weeks. After this point, the bottles can be stored cool or cold.


##### Serving. Pour into a clean glass, being careful to leave the
layer of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Cheers!

#### **IBUs:** 28

#### **ABV:** 5%

#### MALT/GRAIN BILL

#### 4 lb (1.8 kg) Munich malt

#### 3 lb (1.4 kg) Vienna malt

#### 3 lb (1.4 kg) Maris Otter malt

#### 3 oz ( 85 g) Chocolate malt (350L)

#### HOPS SCHEDULE

#### 0.5 oz (14 g) Nugget [14% AA] at 60 minutes

#### 0.75 oz (21 g) Hallertau Mittelfuh [4% AA] at 5 minutes

#### YEAST

#### Wyeast 2206 (Bavarian Lager) yeast

#### DIRECTIONS

#### Mill the grains and mix with 3.2 gallons (12.1 l) of 163°F (73°C) strike water to reach a mash temperature of 152°F (67°C). Hold this temperature for 60 minutes. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, then run off into the kettle. Sparge the grains with 4.1 gallons (15.4 l) and top up as necessary to obtain 6 gallons (23 l) of wort. Boil for 60 minutes, following the hops schedule.

#### After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 50°F (10°C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 50°F (10°C) for 3 days, then allow temperature to rise to 60°F (16°C) over the next 4 days. Upon completion of fermentation, crash the beer to 35°F (2°C), then bottle or keg and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes of CO2.
