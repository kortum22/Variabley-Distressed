## This was really great and the section on Monuments should be required reading for all of America. 

## Highlights::

#### Caste is a system of social hierarchy in which people enjoy varying degrees of superiority or are subject to subjugation based on the caste to which they belong.

### Location 47
#### When the human genome was completely mapped in 2000, it was clearer than ever that all human beings can be traced back to a handful of tribes that originated in Africa and spread out to colonize the entire planet.

### Location 61
#### Under pressure from Southern leaders, the federal government pulled back from Reconstruction efforts meant to give freed slaves a path toward equality. Instead, Jim Crow laws were established that created a new kind of slavery. This was a deliberate, government-sanctioned effort to keep the American caste system in place.

### Location 73
#### Children are extremely adept at picking up on social cues. If they see that their parents treat someone differently, they can carry that information with them for the rest of their lives. This is how caste systems continue to thrive from one generation to the next. These rules aren’t necessarily spoken aloud, but they get passed down nonetheless.

### A caste system requires a set of foundational pillars.

##### Inherent Superiority versus Inherent Inferiority.

### Location 131
#### In 1941, sharecroppers in the South were still being whipped whenever those in the higher castes deemed it necessary. In 1948, a tenant farmer in Mississippi was brutally beaten because he asked for a receipt after paying his water bill.

### Location 137
#### Every step that the lowest caste took upward was taken as a sign that hundreds of years of social order were no longer secure.

### Location 138
#### Part of the reason for this fear is the fact that caste systems create group narcissism.

### Location 145
#### In America, racial narcissism has begun to take a toll on the higher castes. Following the Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and ‘60s, some in the subordinate castes began to achieve elevated status in society. As a result, those in the dominant castes, especially some of their poorer members, began to experience higher rates of elevated blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. The fear of losing one’s place in society can be deadly.

### Location 149
#### Monuments and memorials can help support or dismantle the caste.
##### Location 149
###### It’s easy to look at an old photograph of the massive crowds of Germans who cheered Adolf Hitler and feel certain that you wouldn’t have been one of those people. But the truth is, all human beings can be made to feel insecure and rendered susceptible to propaganda. **Falling into place within the social hierarchy comes quite naturally to all of us. It takes great courage to stand apart from the majority.**

##### Location 152
###### What often goes overlooked is that, when it came time for Nazi leaders to write new laws, they turned to America.

##### Location 159
###### **But Richard Westmoreland, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Marines, made a strong statement when he pointed out that Erwin Rommel was, militarily speaking, a remarkable general, but Germans did not put up statues of him. “They’re ashamed,” Westmoreland said. “Why aren’t we?”**
