## I will not try [[TheBrain]], I will not try [[TheBrain]], I will not try [[TheBrain]]...

## Getting an HR screening meeting for the [[Build - Job Search]] Business Analyst position that I had to take a SQL and Excel test for last week!
### Kind of surprised given the lack of my confidence after it...

### Call scheduled for [[October 28th, 2020]] 12PST/2CST
#### I really really really want this to go well. 

#### Hoing to study up on the requirements/job description/the company as a whole...

#### I’m just so bad in an interview setting...

## Closing on [[Condo Sale - Winchester]] is getting pushed from this Friday to [[October 30th, 2020]]. 
### I think it’s too late to push my movers, but I’m going to try since our move-in date isn’t until [[November 7th, 2020]] anyways...
#### Even if it is, we might get an air mattress or something over here so we can deal with [[Bruce Wayne]] a little easier since the only places we can stay for an extended period won’t let him come...

## Haven’t used my October [[Field Notes]] at all...
### Going back through Roam and adding notes to each day in the notebook. 

### Don’t want this to be my process...
#### Roam is just so easy...

### Need to find a way to keep my notebooks active though. 
#### I love my monthly books and to lose that would be sad. 

## Hazy [[IPA]]’s need to be drank out of a glass. 
### Since we packed all our glasses already, I tried drinking one out of the can today, and felt it was missing something so I found a glass we were going to toss and used it. 

### The aroma really hits you and adds to the experience in a glass.

## [[Media Diet]]
### [[Outliers - Blinkist]]

### Yesterday’s [[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver - HBO]]

### [[Lovecraft Country - HBO]] S1E10

### [[David Byrne’s American Utopia (2020)]]
#### Absolutely loving this. I wish all concert films (and concerts for that matter) were like this. 
##### Not that they need this extensive of a budget and Spike Lee directing, but the thoughtfulness and production to make it more than just a band playing on a stage. 

##### Reminds me a bit of Thom Yorke’s [[Netflix]] thing from a year or so ago, but this is live so it’s just that much better. 

#### This country is “a work-in-progress, we are not fixed,” and we should strive for more, for better, of ourselves, one another, and our country.
