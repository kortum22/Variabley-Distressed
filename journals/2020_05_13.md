## Today's #[[GIF]] ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/ZeijZbSFbVcq47fQBX/giphy.gif)

## Today's LoFi
### [[Timezones, Vol. 1 by Chillhop]]

## I have three main inboxes that I am trying to work-through/clean on a regular basis now.
### [[Instapaper]] (currently 78)

### [[Overcast]] (currently 86)

### [[Drafts ]] (currently 172) (down to 33, the 172 is inflated because it included tagged.)

## Super lazy day so far this morning. Picked up some beer, listened to some podcasts, and scrolled mindlessly. Terrible morning...

## #[[Beers]]
### P3 Oat Lager - [[Phase Three Brewing]]
#### Enjoying this one a lot. Probably my second favorite craft lager.

#### I want to eventually brew my own lager. Probably try to mix the oat elements of this, with the vienna elements of Vienna Lager from [[Maplewood Brewing]], and the dryhop vibes of [[Folletto]] from [[Hop Butcher for the World]].
##### [[The Crushed Cave]]

## Don't really feel like being productive, focusing, or doing anything of substance. Even watching TV sounds awful. Sitting, scrolling, and barely listening to podcasts in the background right now, with my P3 in hand.
