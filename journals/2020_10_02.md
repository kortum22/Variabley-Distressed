## If this idiot actually recovers (which odds are he will, so __actually__ was the wrong word to use there) itâ€™s going to be a shit storm of him saying __it was only the sniffles__ and all of his sheeple will be even more anti-mask and want to open shit up like nothing even happened...
### Iâ€™m just hoping [[Joe Biden]] didnâ€™t catch it...
#### It looks like he and Jill have both tested negative. Hallelujah.

### I see some people doubting the news, saying heâ€™s lying, and while I can get the sentiment just like I stated above when he recovers, but there are more downsides to this for him and is anyone actually surprised the guy who has downplayed it and taken zero precautions actually contracted it?

### Funny to see Jack have some [similar thoughts](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/jackbaty/page/DaQ12w6sx) on his Roam.

### Embedded tweets take up a lot of space...

### Yeah... heâ€™s not racist, huh? from [[Marketing Brew]]

#### President Trumpâ€™s latest shot fired at Madison Avenue came in the form of an executive order telling ad agencies to stop diversity training programs. The order, which was issued on September 22, is equal parts confusing and troubling.
##### It essentially prohibits government contractors, including ad agencies that work with the federal government, from implementing diversity training programs.

##### Every major holding company and many agencies made further investments in such programs this summer after the murders of [[George Floyd]], [[Breonna Taylor]] and [[Ahmaud Arbery]].

## Itâ€™s not even 2pm and Iâ€™m already wanting to crack open a beer.
### Cubs are on now, PSG starting in thirty, and NBA Finals tonight... Have to pace myself since I already said I need to cut back the other day.

## Maybe my resume is just terrible... I hate this shit... #[[Job Search]]

## Reached out to [[David Merfield]] @ [[Blot.im]] about pausing my photo blog so I wouldnâ€™t have to delete it from my account, since both my blogs are up for renewal in a week and he credited me for both payments this year. Super kind of him and a huge help.
### I hate even asking the initial question, especially to an indie service like [[Blot.im]]. But bigger services like [[Hover]] would probably never even consider kindness like that and my domain is likely going to have to renew soon. 

### I really just want a fucking job. Itâ€™s starting to get to me a little more everyday.

### Never heard of these guys before, but saw this on Jackâ€™s Roam and dug it.

#### __That we are even weighing the possibility of the incumbent president inadvertently infecting his opponent with a pandemic virus during a nationally televised event should be an indictment of Americaâ€™s laxity in dealing with the pandemicâ€”its reticence to restrict indoor activities, which give the virus the best chance of finding new hosts; its failure to enforce measures like masks, which might render such events safer; and its continuing inability to control the disease, which many nations have brought to heel.__
