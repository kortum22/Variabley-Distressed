### I think I actually got the [[SQL]] portion right (simple query, really), but there was an [[Excel]] question that I didn't know really how to do in one formula.
#### The easiest way, imo, is doing a pivot and then getting the pacing percentage..., but I tried to do it in one Formula and think I used SUMIF incorrectly... 
##### I did write that Pivot would be the best, since it was freeform, which makes it hard because I'm not used to writing excel formulas outside of excel in a freeform text field... gheherhgbdfhgblkzfblj;fg

### There was a essay question too that just asked how you would handle a situation where you analysis is 100% contradictory with the prevailing thought.
#### I hate these types of questions.

#### I basically said double check x,y,z and if you are still confident with the analysis, move forward, if it's super complex and you think it would be easy to miss something even after a triple checking, then have a colleague check your analysis...
##### I think I wrote it more eloquently than that, but... grrrgahahahadgfag

## Spent a good deal of the day packing for the [[Seattle Move]].

### Tons of fun getting beer samples all over the burbs with my Mom. She likes the fruity sours so it lets me try twice as much beer without having to order myself and drink too much.
