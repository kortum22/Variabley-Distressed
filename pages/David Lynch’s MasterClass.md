## Connecting pieces of a puzzle, first two pieces might not have anything to do with each other. 

## Don’t fish in the desert, get to the right spot. 

## The chef doesn’t make the fish

## "It's not every day you see a battered nude woman come out of the bushes, but these things happen."

## it's extremely important to take time and just daydream. Especially to catch ideas.
### Ideas can come at anytime though as long as you have the desire.	 Remember to capture.
