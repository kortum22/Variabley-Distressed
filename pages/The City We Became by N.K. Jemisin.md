## Thoughts::
### I thought it started out superb. The opening chapter was so beautifully written, every sentence dripped with style and eloquence and fun. There were certain parts through the book that I felt like I was falling asleep, but it ended almost as good as it started.

## Quotes::
### But that’s really why I start paying attention: because of God. I don’t have to believe in something for it to fuck up my life. (7)

### But the separation starts a process, and in that pocket the many parts of the city begin to multiply and differentiate. Its sewers extend into places where there is no need for water. Its slums grow teeth; its art centers, claws. Ordinary things within it, traffic and construction and stuff like that, start to have a rhythm like a heartbeat, if you record their sounds and play them back fast. The city… quickens. (8)

### “The harbingers of the Enemy will hide among the city’s parasites. Beware of them.” (9)

### What good does it do to be valuable, if nobody values you? (9)

### Dreaming, dead dreaming, of a dark place beneath heavy cold waves where something stirs with a slithery sound and uncoils and turns toward the mouth of the Hudson, where it empties into the sea. Toward me. And I am too weak, too helpless, too immobilized by fear, to do anything but twitch beneath its predatory gaze. (10)

### the world can’t hurt you if you just ignore everything that’s wrong with it; well, not until it kills you anyway. (14)

### That’s what’s extra offensive about the art, see. It’s racist, misogynistic, anti-Semitic, homophobic, probably some other shit she isn’t catching at first glance. But it’s also terrible. Not that she really thinks it’s possible to make good art when you hate so many people—art requires empathy141

### “White dude whining as a growth industry,” (154)

### “Real gods aren’t what most of you Christians think of as gods. Gods are people. Sometimes dead people, sometimes still alive. Sometimes never lived.” She shrugs. “They do jobs—bring fortune, look after people, make sure the world works as it should. They fall in love. Have babies. Fight. Die.” She shrugs. “It’s duty. It’s normal. Get over it.” (189)

### “I thought you were a little Punjabi, maybe, until I heard what Mrs. Yu said. What are you, then?” “Black.” It comes out instinctively, and feels true. “You look… half-white?” “Nope. Black.” “Black Latino or maybe Black Jewish or, what is it, Creole…?” “Plain old ordinary Black.” It feels like a familiar conversation. He has gotten this a lot, throughout his life. “I mean, probably other stuff besides Black somewhere back down the line, but I don’t remember if I ever knew what. Or cared.” He shrugs. “America.” (190)

### “People who say change is impossible are usually pretty happy with things just as they are.” (233)

### But these people are always gonna tell themselves that a little fascism is okay as long as they can still get unlimited drinks with brunch!” (241)

### “So, here’s the thing,” she tells them. “All of that stuff is true. All the other worlds that human beings believe in, via group myths or spiritual visitations or even imaginations if they’re vivid enough, they exist. Imagining a world creates it, if it isn’t already there. That’s the great secret of existence: it’s supersensitive to thought. Decisions, wishes, lies—that’s all you need to create a new universe. Every human being on this planet spins off thousands between birth and death, although there’s something about the way our minds work that keeps us from noticing. In every moment, we’re constantly moving in multiple dimensions—we think we’re sitting still, but we’re actually falling from one universe to the next to the next, so fast that it all blends together, like… like animation. Except there’s a lot more than just images flipping past.” (302)

### And before them, grinning so widely that they can see nearly all of her teeth, the living embodiment of the city of R’lyeh spreads her long-fingered, long-nailed, elegant white hands in open invitation. “Come, then, City That Never Sleeps. Let me show you what lurks in the empty spaces where nightmares dare not tread.” (391)

### It’s impossible not to smile, too, even here at the end of the world. Joy is joy. Bronca takes one of her hands, letting her love show; they are family now. Manny takes the other, his expression intent. (426)
