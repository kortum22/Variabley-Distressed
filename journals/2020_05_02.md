## Found out it’s super easy to embed [[YouTube]] videos. 

## I’ve come to realize if you combined [[Robin Sloan]] and [[Warren Ellis]] it’s basically who I want to be. too bad I’m not even a semi-mediocre writer... There are probably some other people to add to this melting pot to truly round it out, but I’ve been scrolling through who Sloan follows on Instagram the last thirty minutes to find new people to follow. Basically anyone he or Ellis’ have recommend are the best accounts I follow at this point.
