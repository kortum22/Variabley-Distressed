## Packing suuuuuucks #[[Seattle Move]]
### 21:37 - whelp I think we are basically packed. Since our closing got pushed out a week, but we couldnâ€™t move the movers, and our move-in isnâ€™t until 11/7, Iâ€™m going to stay in the mostly empty condo with [[Bruce Wayne]] because we couldnâ€™t find anyone with room for two plus a dog.
