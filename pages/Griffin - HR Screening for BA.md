## Hi Hannah,

## 

## I just wanted to thank you for your time today, I apologize for the connection issues I had on my end, I figured out there were some headphones in the other room that were apparently just close enough to cut in a couple times.

## 

## The culture and environment seem like a perfect fit for me based on what you described in terms of everyone always willing to help, while still being fast-paced. I've always considered myself a jack-of-all-trades and a lifetime learner so hopefully it comes across on my resume going from a finance position to IT and picking up the necessary skills and tools along the way.

## 

## Thanks again for your time, I look forward to hearing from you next week.

## -Kevin Kortum
