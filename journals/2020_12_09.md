## The curved ‚Äú+‚Äù for [[Disney +]] annoys me more than it should...

## Heard back from [[CBRE - Job Search]] today...
### Due to the rise in [[COVID-19]] numbers, they‚Äôve put a pause on hiring for this team until February 2021 at the earliest. 

### My position would‚Äôve been client work for Swedish Hospitals, whose income is reduced when numbers go up due to lack of profitable services. 

### This sucks. 

## Sent an email to [[Lowercase Brewing]] to see if they might be willing to let me intern for a couple weeks to learn brewing on a larger scale since I‚Äôm not doing anything anyways...

## Spending some time today #Roaming
### This is basically what I call scrolling through my daily notes pages and shift-clicking to add additional data.

### Also useful for popping out and checking other places like Jack and Phil‚Äôs wikis.
