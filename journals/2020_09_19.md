### 17:36 - [[Bruce Wayne]] was sick overnight and puked. Then puked three more times throughout the day today. Have tried to limit what he eats and how much activity he gets so he can rest and hopefully get better. Fed him rice and eggs for lunch and he hasn’t puked since about two hours before lunch, but I’m still a little nervous.
