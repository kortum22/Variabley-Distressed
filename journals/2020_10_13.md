## Building an All Time Favorites list (Top 100) on Letterboxd. Up to 45 films so far on it.
### Top Ten list for this year is pathetic (obviously) 
#### Have only seen seven films...

## ~~Redacted~~ See [[Private Database]] ([[November 7th, 2020]])
### https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Tiv/page/D60kLGUe2
#### Hoping this link only works for me when logged in...
##### Appears to be the case when in Private browsing.

### This is probably the type of thing that should go in the private database...

## Watching the [[Apple Event]]
### Didn't catch if the HomePod mini's have any potential linking featuer with the original HomePod's.
#### Not that I own one anyways... just curious.

#### ((31533bf3-daee-4e95-98fd-b9b0d33fcabc))
##### Nope

#### Wonder if these can be repaired...

### I like the flat edges on the iPhone 12.

### [[MagSafe]]!!!
#### Really like the wallet stick on and the double charger thingy that folds up.
##### Would be cool to have a [[Bellroy]] [[MagSafe]] wallet.  

### Love that they make “removing headphones and power adapter” an environmental thing 🤣🤣🤣
#### Obviously, yes, it’s helpful, but probably a cost thing. 

#### And the cord is USB-C??? General iPhone owners don’t have USB-C blocks! 

### $699 seems like a high starting price...? Maybe I’m remembering incorrectly. 

### Pro’s have always been focused on photography, but this year feels even more so. Don’t think I need it. On an 11 non-Pro now. 

### Still not sure I’m going to get a new phone, despite being on the [[iPhone Upgrade Program]]. 
#### To keep the same 128GB and go from iPhone 11 -> iPhone 12, my upgrade program monthly fee would go up $5. If I went down to 64GB, it would still go up $3. 

#### Even a mini would be $1 more a month to keep the same 128GB!

## Approved for the apartment! #[[Seattle Move]]
### Now lets just hope the buyer is cleared to close on [[October 16th, 2020]] and then all should be peachy. #[[Condo Sale - Winchester]]

## Streaming just makes it too easy to add songs and albums to your library. 
### It just makes it diluted with stuff I like, but don’t love. 

### After unsubscribing to [[Apple Music]] I could see just the stuff I bought from iTunes and it was a delight. 
#### Wish all my CDs were there too though... 
##### Ripped them a long time ago, but stupid Apple Match made them disappear when I let a sub lapse. 
###### Have a drive with most of them though... just too lazy... and don’t know if adding to Music would have them show up on my phone without some sort of sub.
