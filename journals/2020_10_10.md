## [[Seattle Move]] Apartment Hunting Day 3
### Two tours scheduled, trying to get another one or two in as well. 

### Apartment 4 was super nice, but expensive and not really in the neighborhood we want to be. 

### Apartment 5 was probably the best when you factor in price, location, size. 

### Apartment 6, we werenâ€™t able to see. Getting info over email...

### Apartment 7 added... virtual tour to come.
